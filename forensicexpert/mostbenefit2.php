<h1>Getting The Most Out Of Your Medical Expert:</h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 2 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>The process</strong></br>
Medical experts need to be located, assessed for preliminary suitability, retained and later declared as an expert.
The procedure is very active to maximize the value of your medical expert consultant.
<br><br>
<strong>Preliminaries of retaining an expert</strong></br>
Once one has decided that a particular expert is the logical one to retain, one has to assess the match of the medical aspects of a case with the expert’s suitability in the context of the opinions (s)he will express. 
This means that retaining an expert does not mean a commitment to proceed with that expert through the case.
A carefully worded pre-retaining phase may ensue where the attorney very briefly describes the key facts in the case. The expert usually will not be able to express an opinion at that stage. Sometimes, however, I have been able to indicate to attorneys that the particular case does not fall within my experience range or my expertise; and at times, I indicate the converse. 
<br><br>
The attorney must ensure that it cannot be claimed that the expert formed his / her opinion from the attorney or was unduly influenced by the attorney. Consequently, more commonly, this means initially giving the expert preliminary key documents about the case and obtaining feedback, generally oral, from the expert as to preliminary opinions. Such an early step may save substantial costs if the expert is not regarded as appropriate for the particular case as a full review of documents could take many, many hours and yet the key elements could be assessed in two or three. 
<br><br>
After retaining, there may be a period of intention to declare if necessary, during which you may be maximizing that expert’s knowledge in the area about which (s)he will testify. You are also receiving feedback from your expert such that you know in which areas to declare him / her and what limitations you will put on that description. 
<br><br>
<strong>Commitment and declaring an expert</strong></br>
You have retained your expert: The commitment to an expert is made more permanent once the expert is declared or the definite decision is made to declare him / her at an appropriate later time (e.g. when experts need to be made public). 
You have decided you will proceed with that expert and you need to utilize as many techniques as possible to optimize having that expert. 
<br><br>
Clearly, one wants to save the expert time, because that will save the attorney money. But do not make the error of trying a short-cut with your key expert. Always ensure (s)he is provided with everything that could possibly be deemed necessary to ensure an adequate educated well-thought out opinion that the other side cannot negate due to not disclosing everything necessary 
<br><br>
You also want to ensure that the expert is as adequately prepared as possible for the specific tasks (s)he is assigned to do. This may be testamentary, but very often it is consultative, or writing a declaration, report or letter. 
This may require adequate educating on the legal aspects of the case. This can sometimes be time-consuming particularly if the expert is not experienced or specifically forensically trained. This can easily be more costly than retaining a more expensive, more experienced and knowledgeable expert. 
<br><br>
It is necessary at the appropriate time to declare the expert carefully. The exact wording should be discussed carefully with the expert consultant prior to such submissions as it may effect all his / her future testimony. Clearly, adverse opinions on certain issues may limit the expert as to being declared only in the area where (s)he can address the strengths of the case not its weaknesses
<br><br>
<strong>Balanced opinions</strong></br>
The medical expert’s perception of the strengths and weaknesses of a case must be balanced and not rejected because his / her opinion disagrees with that of the retaining attorney’s. The expert’s opinions may involve multiple different areas of the case. For example, the expert may describe significant brain damage and this may not be something the defense attorney may want to hear; on the other hand, he may describe the profound limitations of ascribing causality to the injury that is being alleged. . But alternatively, his / her perception of brain damage may actually be less than that of an opposition expert so (s)he may still be so declared!
<br><br>
However, there is a balance. Sometimes the limitations in the case are obvious, and the expert drawing attention to it allows credibility. Although it may be negating something, it may be an area that will be lost anyway. For example, the defense counsel in a malpractice suit may realize that the adverse consequences for the plaintiff patient are very clear and the defense expert may plan to admit this information to a jury, allowing him / her the legitimacy to argue that that there is no link between these adverse problems and any dereliction of duty by the physician—the adversity was not proximately related. 
<br><br>
Commonly, also, it is a case of the cup being half empty or half full. The same data, and the same opinions can sometimes be expressed to adequately cover the strengths of the case, without compromising the integrity of the witness. This is what the real medicolegal expert can sometimes do, whereas a physician specialist knowledgeable in the area may not be able to persuade a jury of the relevance of a specific balanced viewpoint for the plaintiff or defense. 
<br><br>
<strong>Early decisions</strong></br> 
The expert’s opinion may lead to decisions as to early outcome. Sometimes it is better to contemplate mediation or arbitration particularly when a trial has a high risk of an adverse outcome. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong></br>
Retaining an expert is an active and critical process involving feedback. This impacts important decisions.<br><br>
