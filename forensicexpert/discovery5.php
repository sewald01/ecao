<h1>The Discovery Deposition: </h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 5 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>

<strong>The active process continues</strong></br>
The discovery deposition could be the most neglected area of overall case evaluation for the retaining attorneys. 
Retaining attorneys may spend a very necessary hour with the witness before the deposition but such limited interaction may be insufficient for what should be an active process. There should be an active predeposition phase followed by a well-planned deposition period.
<br><br>
<strong>The predeposition phase</strong></br>
The retaining attorney, if necessary, needs to educate his / her expert about the appropriate style to adopt during discovery deposition. This should not be necessary with an experienced forensic expert who will be aware of the pitfalls of such a deposition. 
<br><br>
The balance for the expert, after discussion with his retaining counsel, is to ensure that the key information (s)he wants to mention at trial will not be eliminated.
 <br><br>
This usually means (s)he should cover this data or mention it at deposition. If necessary, he will bring up these issues at deposition. 
<br><br>
The exceptions would be if (s)he had mentioned the information before that time, e.g. a previously discovered letter by the expert or a properly worded declaration may serve this purpose. In those instances, if the discovering attorney does not cover those areas, (s)he will have to accept the disadvantage of hearing testimony on them at trial, without knowing exactly the experts points. Similarly, if an expert has been specifically declared, as dealing with a specific issue and this is not covered, this then becomes the discovering attorney’s problem. But the latter may, nevertheless, dispute that it was raised at deposition and is not admissible, and often a fine line may decide admissibility of such information. 
<br><br>
<strong>Expert witness style during the discovery deposition</strong><br> 
The retaining attorney must understand the expert may testify very differently at deposition than at trial. At deposition, the expert may show a rather labored, detailed style of checking all information. He may not volunteer information. At trial, he should not need to check the information given by his retaining counsel as he should be familiar with it and he may give spontaneous opinions and use metaphors to help the jury. 
<br><br>
However, sometimes at discovery deposition, the expert may in fact make important points voluntarily, effectively scoring home runs, knowing the case is likely to be settled. Clearly, this strategy needs to be pre-decided by the retaining counsel. Consequently, the style of the same expert consultant may vary considerably. 
<br><br>
The opposing attorney will try to ensure some information not be admissible because this is not being asked at deposition. It is the retaining attorney’s task to ensure this will not happen. 
On the other hand, the latter does not want areas that have not been brought up to be mentioned, but which have definitely been established as appropriate material for the expert to discuss in court, because that gives him / her a major advantage in court. 
<br><br>
The retaining attorney, wisely, may rarely ask questions during discovery deposition cross-examination, but at times, interventions are necessary. In Obstetric Medicine, the concept of “masterly inactivity” allows the obstetrician to observe and allow nature to take its course during the delivery of a baby; but if there are complications, immediate intervention is available. Masterly inactivity should be role of the vigilant retaining attorney.
<br><br>
<strong>Unmentioned issues</strong></br>
Sometimes, because the expert had not mentioned something (s)he should have mentioned during his / her deposition, motions to exclude may lead to excluded evidence. Alternatively, the issue may not have been brought up deliberately by the discovering attorney so that (s)he can spring it on the expert consultant at trial, during cross-examination, or via a motion to the judge. 
Sometimes, the information is just not available in time for deposition. 
<br><br>
The retaining counsel should ensure that the medical expert should know that (s)he will never admit at deposition that (s)he has expressed all the opinions (s)he will express at trial. When asked about articles (s)he will indicate ongoing knowledge, and when not asked about areas, instead of cuing the deposing attorney, (s)he may just indicate that there are “twenty inches of notes, plus a patient examination here. We have not covered all areas and I may, if asked to do so, express an opinion at trial on something we’ve not covered.” When asked for examples, the expert may point to all the notes, and the whole body of knowledge in the literature, though (s)he must concede that (s)he will let his / her retaining attorney know if his / her opinion has changed as a consequence. 
<br><br>
There is a fine balance, in this regard, often answered by various techniques by the retaining counsel. 
An occasional legitimate technique is for the retaining side to argue that the deposition is incomplete, or that it has gone so much over time that they have not had the opportunity to ask about key features on cross examination. At trial, if the opposing attorney objects that the specific issue was not discussed at deposition, the responses may still be admissible because the opposite attorney did not discover that information. It is no-one’s fault but his / her own. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, the expert consultant may not have data, articles, X-rays, tests or copies of reports available. (S)He may potentially be appropriately excluded unless the expert indicates his / her intention to evaluate such data, and to convey his / her findings on such information to the attorneys if it changes his / her opinion, or to, if necessary be deposed again. 
There are limitations to such approaches if the information could have been provided before that time, and the expert legitimately could have been provided with it. On the other hand, (s)he could not expect to comment on exhibits discovered after his / her deposition. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong></br>
Adequate planning and strategies are necessary for discovery depositions. It is at that point that the regular season really begins. The trial itself or mediation or settlement is the playoffs.<br><br>
