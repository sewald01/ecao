<h1>Preparing For Court Testimony: The Early Phase:</h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 6 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Vernon M. Neppe MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DFAPA*</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Testimony begins long before the trial</strong><br>
The expert consultant does not become inactive waiting for his / her trial testimony after the deposition is over. There is plenty interchange that should be taking place with the legal team.
<br><br>
<strong>Trial or settlement?</strong><br>
Trial testimony begins before trial with the decision as to which witnesses to call, and, in fact, whether settlement of the case beforehand may not be appropriate. 
Up until the moment the expert testifies the case may suddenly be settled. Similarly, decisions to prevent a court hearing via arbitration or mediation may be made. In these instances, the expert’s opinion may be critical. Opposing counsel information at mediation, for example, may be medically inaccurate. If settlement does not occur, the extra knowledge of ammunition to be used may become valuable, even if any written mediation information could not be used in court as exhibits. 
<br><br>
<strong>Witness experience in testifying</strong><br>
You must know the strengths and limitations of your expert. For example:<br>
What is his / her expertise in court?<br>
What is his / her expertise in public speaking?<br>
What is his / her expertise in thinking on his / her feet?<br>
<br><br>
Unless you know your expert’s strengths and limitations, you cannot adequately prepare your case. 
<br><br>
Stylistically, experts vary. Personally, I am very different in deposition compared with trial. In deposition, I may be careful about compound questions. 
At trial, I know what is going to be asked. 
It is important for the attorney to know this, otherwise (s)he may think his / her expert is the verbose, detailed, pernickety individual the discovery attorney encountered in deposition.
<br><br>
<strong>What retaining counsel should ensure</strong><br>
Clearly the expert consultant should not be compromised in any way and his / her knowledge and information about specifics maximized, so the legitimacy of his / her court testimony can be improved. 
<br><br>
1.	Make sure your experts have examined the patient. Sometimes this is impossible—the patient is dead. At other times, the examination is not relevant: for example, the critical patient injury occurred years before and the retrospective data obtained during examination may no longer be relevant in the tort.<br><br> 
2.	Alternatively, the patient may be so profoundly demented that real communication is impossible and visualization of an adequate videotaped assessment may be adequate for evaluation instead of live physical examination. <br><br>
3.	Make sure your experts have interviewed key people, even if only briefly, such as spouse or family members or employers or co-employees or relevant health professionals like nurses or doctors, so that (s)he can obtain an adequate perspective in relation to the patient’s function. The attorney may need to compose a key interview list. However, (s)he must ensure that such interviews are purely information gathering, so that the other side cannot effectively claim that the witness was unduly or inappropriately influence during the interview.<br><br>
4.	Make sure your expert knows exactly how (s)he has been declared and the range of his / her testimony. <br><br>
5.	 Ensure that the expert does not exceed his / her expertise such that a jury will want to discard even his / her opinions in his / her areas of expertise. Sometimes (s)he may testify as an expert but indicate that (s)he is only qualified to do so in the context of his / her specialty (the family practitioner may express medical opinions despite not being a specialist in the area, but frequently defers to the specialist). <br><br>
6.	At times, such testimony may be particularly valuable (e.g. expected standard of care in a malpractice case) indicating the specific knowledge or skills peers.<br><br>
<br><br>
These are the obvious areas. The following are far subtler, despite being at times invaluable:<br><br>
•	Make sure your expert is prepared to, at least, prepare a short rough draft to assist in concretizing his / her ideas. The draft may or may not be sent to anyone. Sometimes such a draft is telegraphic, so that even if discoverable, it will not mean much to anyone else.<br><br>
•	Make sure the expert creates a list of key points that (s)he feels may strengthen the case that (s)he is prepared to testify about. This is the most commonly neglected facet of adequate preparation. <br><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
You should not leave issues open until just before testimony. Adequate planning beginning a month earlier will allow for a successful transition to the time of storm and stress: Just before trial and the trial itself.<br><br>
