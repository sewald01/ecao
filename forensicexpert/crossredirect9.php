<h1>The Cross and Redirect Examination of the Expert:</h1>

<strong>The cross examination challenge</strong><br>
The key to successful testimony is appropriately getting through the cross-examination. 
The cross examination in trial is the most stressful and challenging period for the expert. Preparation is more difficult because there is an aggressive pitcher probing at the expert’s weaknesses and points. But there are ways to optimize this experience. 
If the retaining attorney has does his or her job well during direct examination, much of the thunder would have already been taken out of the cross examination.
<br><br>
<strong>The attack</strong><br>
An early area for the cross-examining counsel to attack, particularly if the witness’s evidence is cogent, legitimate and powerful, is to use the ad hominem argument — attack the expert’s credentials. This is, of course, dangerous for both sides:<br>
The cross-examining attorney has to be very subtle otherwise the jury may be turned against him. <br>
On the other hand, sometimes the opposition attorney may feel (s)he can destroy the witness by such an action. Invariably areas of witness vulnerability should have been discussed beforehand so that the retaining attorney knows in which ways the responses can be appropriately handled during re-direct examination. Often, the apparent limitation can be turned into a virtue: The expert may very much rebut the cross-examiner; or during redirect examination, (s)he may be given the opportunity to be portrayed as better or more competent than other experts on the opposite side, who may be expressing contrary opinions. Clearly, these are difficult goals. And clearly the redirect attorney should have checked any such key information elicited during the discovery deposition and planned optimal responses. 
<br><br>
The attorney and the expert both have to be aware of what is happening at cross-examination. 
The expert’s answers are often short and not directed towards the jury.<br> 
If a particular test is brought up, the expert might begin to indicate that the test is not valid or appropriate for a particular reason even if his / her response is thrown out as not directly answering the question. But this cues the retaining attorney. <br>
Or (s)he may just by looking at his / her attorney directly or nodding indicate “ask me more on this.”<br>
Baseball has signs. A skilled witness can communicate with his / her attorney. But signs must be understood. 
<br><br>
During the cross-examination, the opposing attorney may be focusing on the normal findings or the abnormal findings of an irrelevant test, knowing the jury does not really have the skill or knowledge to discriminate for relevance. In return, the expert may wish to request source documents. This slows down the cross examination considerably and may even not allow the other side to complete their questioning. 
<br><br>
The expert’s responses to an attack rather than the answers he or she gives may be the key element of successfully controlling the cross-examination. An easy, straightforward approach without being ruffled may negate a violent cross examiners attack. 
<br><br>
Many attorneys teach their experts how to face the jury. The expert will not usually be looking at the jury during the redirect examination, unless (s)he scores a home run. But the expert will be communicating in a subtle way with his / her attorney, effectively asking him / her to tell more. 
<br><br>
<strong>The attorney listener</strong><br>
All the while during the cross examination, the retaining counsel is listening carefully. Often the expert may not fully appreciate the line of questioning of the opposing counsel. The expert is not an attorney. Nor is he aware of all the preceding issues and anticipated points to be made. It is here that the retaining attorney is at his most active, preparing for redirect examination.
<br><br>
<strong>Redirect examination</strong><br>
It is key to give your expert the opportunity to respond to the cross-examination by the retaining attorney adequately re-directing the examination. If this is an open question like “in summary…” or “do you have other points to mention”, the judge may not allow the line of questioning. 
<br><br>
It is vital to have enough confidence in your expert to give him / her the opportunity to answer questions that you may not have come up with. 
One technique would be: “Doctor you were asked about X, I note you were asked just to give a yes or no answer. It seemed you wanted to put your answer in perspective. Would you please clarify exactly what you meant.” Sometimes one can be a little more nonspecific. “I note that for A, B, C and D, you were asked for yes or no answers. Did you feel that you adequately portrayed your answer just by yes or no?” And if the expert answers no, then say “would you please explain.” This way the expert is given the opportunity to counter areas that the attorney, who is not a medical doctor, may not even realize. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
The cross examination in the bottom of the ninth is the most stressful and carefully constructed element in the whole lengthy expert process. But you are not passively involved. There is a tenth inning that is often needed and you must ensure that the home runs make your preparation for the win stick. <br><br>
