  <strong>Preface</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea for this monograph arose from several practical experiences I had where I felt that the attorney who had retained me could have maximized any contributions I could make more effectively. In talking to other expert colleagues, I found that this was a common complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Because of this, I decided to write a series of articles that could be freely available on the Internet. The electronic version is being produced on PDF, and because of this, there is no need for an index, as the search function enables the reader to find any word or phrase of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now I know there is a great deal written by attorneys for attorneys on this topic, but suggestions arising from an experienced medical expert consultant were not common.
  <br>
  <br>
  I began with four short sections and ended with nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  I realized that there was a need for this series to be properly done, hence it is published as an electronic monograph.
  <br>
  <br>
  This monograph has been peer reviewed by several attorneys and a medical expert.
  <br>
  <br>
  I hope it will serve its purpose in assisting litigation attorneys, for both defense and plaintiff, in the optimal planning of how to choose and use their medical expert consultants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although written in the civil context, I believe that this series may also be valuable in criminal law and in competency issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of course, any advice and opinions given are general: individual cases must be evaluated according to their specific circumstances.

<h1>Retaining The Appropriate Medicolegal Expert:</h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant: A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 1 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Vernon M. Neppe MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DDFAPA*</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Perspective</strong><br>
Expert testimony begins by finding an appropriate match. 
Finding the correct medicolegal expert for a case is clearly dependent on, not only their expertise in the area, but their forensic proficiency at review, advisory and testamentary levels, as well as the respect they will command, their geographic location and the costs involved. 
<br><br>
Attorneys have to find medicolegal experts very carefully. Choices not only relate to skills in court, but the assistance that can be given prior to any testimony. 
In choosing, one should create a list of what is needed and a shortlist of who can fill that role. 
You should list the strengths and limitations of your potential expert. 
This involves not only knowledge and expertise with the specific medical problems being analyzed, but skills such as incisive thinking, quick responsiveness, communication skills, responsibility, integrity and ability to work efficiently but rapidly. 
<br><br>
<strong>Expert characteristics</strong><br>
Clearly there are specifics that lead some experts to be retained above others. 
Expertise in a health care specialty is only one component to consider. Respect in the medical discipline is often a major index of success as an expert. The components of such esteem are predicated on peer respect, appropriate qualifications and recognition in the area.
Several other qualities should be relatively self-evident, but appear commonly neglected. All characteristics are important, and could sometimes be critical, to a case. The balance of importance of each feature may depend on the specific case. 
<br><br>
Real expertise involves experience combined with knowledge ultimately translated into being credible to a jury, clear in guidelines for the judge, and able to truly advise the retaining counsel.
 Factors that are more obvious are: 
•	Experience in the forensic arena with appropriate testimony 
•	Mix of plaintiff and defense testimonies. 
•	Indestructibility of the expert’s CV. 
•	Clinical experience with the particular issues relevant to the case.
Less obvious is that clinical expertise is quite separate from medicolegal skills. Look for these specific criteria:
•	A general forensic background so as to be able to interpret medical information into probabilities. 
•	Court system knowledge and awareness of the legal intricacies of the case for that geographic area. 
•	Understanding the issues including the subtle differences that the opposition counsel may be probing. 
•	Membership or recognition in appropriate organizations. For example, an epilepsy expert should belong to an organization like the American Epilepsy Society or equivalent, just as a basic for his credibility.
•	Similarly specialist recognition is relevant. Sometimes attorneys use phrases like “Are you board certified?” and whereas that is adequate, better is to ask about any specialist certifications, particularly as many medical experts are not trained in the USA, and several areas such as Neuropsychiatry do not have a board certification. In that instance, the expertise can be demonstrated in other ways e.g. listings in Americas Top Doctors.
•	Expertise also implies appropriate publications in the area, as well as any teaching or lecturing experience in that discipline.
<br><br>
<strong>The more neglected skills</strong><br>
I have seldom been asked by retaining attorneys about whether I possess certain special skills. And yet, in my opinion, these are key considerations:
The medical expert must have the ability to advise his / her counsel carefully. 
This involves the ability to find the medical strengths and weaknesses of a case, and to advise in that regard. 
This sometimes involves further researching the area but this extra attention can pay enormous dividends for the retaining attorney be (s)he counsel for the defense or the plaintiff in a civil trial or for the prosecution or defendant criminally:
The expert needs to be incisive enough to pick up the limitations and strengths of the case in the context of his / her specialty: These limitations commonly may not be realized by the retaining team initially, because they are not expert physicians. 
The expert should be asked about processing skills: speed, thoroughness and incisiveness. 
Rapid processing may save costs only when combined with thoroughness about all relevant details, making sufficient notes for use later and the skill at making interpretations and incisively picking pick up the key subtleties of the case. 
<br><br>
Some experts are nationally or internationally known in their fields. This can be a major advantage. They charge more. But their knowledge, influence, skills and incisiveness can assist enormously. Even more so the respect they accord compared with their opposition is profound. On the other hand, for small cases, the costs of a nationally reputed expert may not be manageable, and a solid local expert may be quite adequate. 
<br><br>
<strong>Expertise in testimony</strong><br>
The medical expert’s skills often translate into expertise in court, coherent expressions to a judge, and persuasiveness for a jury. The expert has to be able to communicate information clearly and appropriately. This witness needs to be able to interact with juries effectively when applicable. Interaction skills can sometimes be reflected by expertise in public speaking—this seldom asked about. Moreover, testimony involves situations which frequently requires the expert to quickly and appropriately think on his / her feet.
 Positive pointers may be:
•	Ability to communicate in conversation with the attorney. 
•	Experience in public speaking e.g. lecturing reputation, TV and radio. 
•	Experience in thinking on feet and the ability to respond appropriately. 
<br><br>
Evaluate an expert using all these parameters. Do not judge them because they may have a website or are promoted on the Internet. Their practice and skills are what are relevant and the added availability of information is generally advantageous in allowing more appropriate information from which to choose, as opposed to someone who is not organized and does not have the information readily available. 
<br><br>
<strong>Credibility</strong><br>
Choices are complicated by knowing that a credible expert will express an honest opinion. This may lead to the expert expressing an opinion that is unfavorable to the particular case. 
However, this may not be a disadvantage. 
The key is knowing your case’s strengths and limitations. 
<br><br>
You should respect your expert’s thoughts. (S)He is generally trying to assist you, and his / her adverse opinion usually is well founded. 
If the expert’s opinion is entirely adverse, this may be a reason not to declare him / her further and find another expert provided a gray zone of opinion legitimately exists for that issue. On the other hand, it may be a strong clue, unless there are other cogent circumstances, to cut one’s losses and to settle the case or not bring it to trial or even not to file it.
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</Strong><br>
Choosing a medical expert consultant requires critical evaluations of numerous features beyond obvious medical expertise. This is even more so for the key witnesses in a case.
<br><br>
<h1>Getting The Most Out Of Your Medical Expert:</h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 2 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Vernon M. Neppe MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DDFAPA*</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>The process</strong></br>
Medical experts need to be located, assessed for preliminary suitability, retained and later declared as an expert.
The procedure is very active to maximize the value of your medical expert consultant.
<br><br>
<strong>Preliminaries of retaining an expert</strong></br>
Once one has decided that a particular expert is the logical one to retain, one has to assess the match of the medical aspects of a case with the expert’s suitability in the context of the opinions (s)he will express. 
This means that retaining an expert does not mean a commitment to proceed with that expert through the case.
A carefully worded pre-retaining phase may ensue where the attorney very briefly describes the key facts in the case. The expert usually will not be able to express an opinion at that stage. Sometimes, however, I have been able to indicate to attorneys that the particular case does not fall within my experience range or my expertise; and at times, I indicate the converse. 
<br><br>
The attorney must ensure that it cannot be claimed that the expert formed his / her opinion from the attorney or was unduly influenced by the attorney. Consequently, more commonly, this means initially giving the expert preliminary key documents about the case and obtaining feedback, generally oral, from the expert as to preliminary opinions. Such an early step may save substantial costs if the expert is not regarded as appropriate for the particular case as a full review of documents could take many, many hours and yet the key elements could be assessed in two or three. 
<br><br>
After retaining, there may be a period of intention to declare if necessary, during which you may be maximizing that expert’s knowledge in the area about which (s)he will testify. You are also receiving feedback from your expert such that you know in which areas to declare him / her and what limitations you will put on that description. 
<br><br>
<strong>Commitment and declaring an expert</strong></br>
You have retained your expert: The commitment to an expert is made more permanent once the expert is declared or the definite decision is made to declare him / her at an appropriate later time (e.g. when experts need to be made public). 
You have decided you will proceed with that expert and you need to utilize as many techniques as possible to optimize having that expert. 
<br><br>
Clearly, one wants to save the expert time, because that will save the attorney money. But do not make the error of trying a short-cut with your key expert. Always ensure (s)he is provided with everything that could possibly be deemed necessary to ensure an adequate educated well-thought out opinion that the other side cannot negate due to not disclosing everything necessary 
<br><br>
You also want to ensure that the expert is as adequately prepared as possible for the specific tasks (s)he is assigned to do. This may be testamentary, but very often it is consultative, or writing a declaration, report or letter. 
This may require adequate educating on the legal aspects of the case. This can sometimes be time-consuming particularly if the expert is not experienced or specifically forensically trained. This can easily be more costly than retaining a more expensive, more experienced and knowledgeable expert. 
<br><br>
It is necessary at the appropriate time to declare the expert carefully. The exact wording should be discussed carefully with the expert consultant prior to such submissions as it may effect all his / her future testimony. Clearly, adverse opinions on certain issues may limit the expert as to being declared only in the area where (s)he can address the strengths of the case not its weaknesses
<br><br>
<strong>Balanced opinions</strong></br>
The medical expert’s perception of the strengths and weaknesses of a case must be balanced and not rejected because his / her opinion disagrees with that of the retaining attorney’s. The expert’s opinions may involve multiple different areas of the case. For example, the expert may describe significant brain damage and this may not be something the defense attorney may want to hear; on the other hand, he may describe the profound limitations of ascribing causality to the injury that is being alleged. . But alternatively, his / her perception of brain damage may actually be less than that of an opposition expert so (s)he may still be so declared!
<br><br>
However, there is a balance. Sometimes the limitations in the case are obvious, and the expert drawing attention to it allows credibility. Although it may be negating something, it may be an area that will be lost anyway. For example, the defense counsel in a malpractice suit may realize that the adverse consequences for the plaintiff patient are very clear and the defense expert may plan to admit this information to a jury, allowing him / her the legitimacy to argue that that there is no link between these adverse problems and any dereliction of duty by the physician—the adversity was not proximately related. 
<br><br>
Commonly, also, it is a case of the cup being half empty or half full. The same data, and the same opinions can sometimes be expressed to adequately cover the strengths of the case, without compromising the integrity of the witness. This is what the real medicolegal expert can sometimes do, whereas a physician specialist knowledgeable in the area may not be able to persuade a jury of the relevance of a specific balanced viewpoint for the plaintiff or defense. 
<br><br>
<strong>Early decisions</strong></br> 
The expert’s opinion may lead to decisions as to early outcome. Sometimes it is better to contemplate mediation or arbitration particularly when a trial has a high risk of an adverse outcome. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong></br>
Retaining an expert is an active and critical process involving feedback. This impacts important decisions.<br><br>
<h1>Records and the Medical Expert: </h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 3 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Vernon M. Neppe MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DDFAPA*</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Perspective</strong><br>
Notes received from retaining attorneys are extremely variable. Adequate preparation can not only save the expert time, but can clarify the case such that the expert can perform optimally.
<br><br>
<strong>Document preparation</strong><br>
There are costs that are necessary:
Rather obvious is the review of the appropriate medical records. All records that are relevant to the expert’s testimony should be supplied. Sometimes, with key witnesses, this may mean all documents pertinent to the case. Whereas this may not be entirely ideal, pragmatism plays a role. The attorney should be careful whom (s)he chooses for that task, as doing this for five or six experts could easily make costs overwhelming. Generally, in each case, there may be one or two key witnesses. The others may be declared in a limited way and receive all relevant documents for the specific area of expertise only. They should carefully obtain only what is relevant information for the specific declaration. 
The easiest cost saver is a well constructed file of pertinent pages with indexes as well as a brief summary letter containing only facts, e.g. date of alleged incident, demographics, alleged claims and questions to be answered. 
This can save enormous time for the witness—as well as result in less expert costs. 
Some attorneys prepare a chronology. This is often extremely useful. This should only be given after the expert has examined the notes, so that the expert would have formed his / her opinion beforehand. 
<br><br>
<strong>Computerized materials</strong><br>
Experts’ styles vary. For example, my specific preferences may not be generalizable, particularly if the expert is not very computer savvy. Personally, I like to summarize information as I read it, extracting key information. This I will do digitally by dictation, generally referencing dates, pages and medical professionals. This saves enormous time in reviewing cases later. 
I also like to use text documents (e.g. in Microsoft Word). This allows me to fashion the detail and extract what is relevant without wasting time rewriting. 
In this regard, scanning by the attorney is worthwhile, particularly if text (as opposed to pictures [e.g. TIFF, PICT]) is produced. This text is editable in summary documents, and can be searched almost instantaneously. It becomes a great time saver. 
<br><br>
Depositions should always be ordered in text form so they can have the relevant facets extracted. Hard copies should also be available. 
The attorney should ensure that the expert knows what has been duplicated on CD and paper. 
<br><br>
However, scanned computerized material supplied as PDFs that cannot be converted into text has an enormous downside of taking up time in locating particular pages. Consequently, an index is essential for any scanned non-text documents, and additionally duplicate hard copies of the text are valuable. 
<br><br>
The logic is: Save the expensive expert time by using a paralegal assistant to do as much acceptable spade work as possible. But supply the expert with a CD of the notes and (s)he can carry it around on his / her computer while traveling. 
<br><br>
<strong>Speed versus thoroughness and adequate interpretation time</strong><br>
The expert should be asked about speed and thoroughness. 
<br><br>
Speed of processing notes can be a time saver and therefore a money saver. If the expert is known to do tasks quickly that is excellent but it ultimately will save costs only if the speed necessarily involves thoroughness about essentials. Thoroughness implies not compromising essential time and ensuring all relevant details are processed. This means that those documents that need detail should be looked at thoroughly. The good expert makes sufficient notes initially, to save great time later. 
<br><br>
However, often there are pages that are supplied for completeness, but which the competent expert will recognize can be dealt with more cursorily, without compromising the case. 
<br><br>
Examination of notes has a profoundly important, but sometimes neglected element: The expert must allocate some time to make interpretations. This is often neglected. This is sometimes the most relevant time investment in the whole case: The forensic expert plays the role of scientific detective and needs to pick up subtleties. 
Incisive thinking is a particularly useful quality: The expert effectively is part of the medical chess game. 
<br><br>
<strong>Research</strong><br>
The expert will be asked about literature in testimony and have to justify it. You need to be aware of this. It adds costs. But a smart law firm can prepare the appropriate key articles beginning with key abstracts asking the expert what (s)he needs. 
<br><br>
Commonly, the key features of such articles are listed in a good abstract, or a summary which is disclosed to both sides and has been made by the retaining attorneys. Carefully done and when performed within the framework of appropriate rules, this can save significant costs. 
Moreover, the retained expert can often do a broad search of Index Medicus on a subject in 2-4 hours. 
If the expert is not using a bibliographic computerized program (s)he should be. It is a great time saver. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
Adequate preparation of medical and other relevant documents sent to experts can make the difference to the outcome of a case. The interchange is active, and do not ignore the expert’s needs for other relevant data.<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>The partnership</strong><br>
Your medical expert is your partner in the case. The difference is (s)he is going to give you an honest appraisal. You should aim to maximize information and opinions given. You must evaluate how even adverse opinions can be incorporated into your case. You need a devil’s advocate because your opposition counsel will play that role!
On the other hand, there are always subtle differences of procedure in various jurisdiction and even between courts and judges of the same jurisdiction: The attorney needs to know his battle turf, and pick up local rules and practices and be able to warn the expert of particular local pitfalls.
<br><br>
<strong>Early consultations</strong><br>
Plan to use your expert in his / her key area of expertise. If you take him / her out of his / her key area of expertise, his / her opinion may not reflect an accurate perspective of the case. This may cause the expert to misinterpret his / her information and may mislead the retaining counsel. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, expressing incorrect opinions may compromise the value of the expert to a judge, jury and the opposing counsel who may use him / her for cannon fodder and generalize their ostensible disdain to the whole case. To make the expert extremely broad e.g. to make a neurologist or psychiatrist into a neuroradiologist, can sometimes work because they can argue they see MRI films. 
On the other hand, to make a neuropsychologist into a neuropsychiatrist may well fail the test of adequate opinions of all the areas impacting the case including pharmacological interventions. The expert must recognize his / her limitations when advising his / her client. 
<br><br>
To get the most out of the expert it is highly preferable that the expert be consulted early. This way any adverse opinions that are severely dissonant with the opinions the attorney is seeking may lead to abandoning the first expert and using another instead. 
However, consonant ideas may be fashioned so strongly in a letter, that early settlement of the case may result. 
Sometimes, the expert’s explaining of the strengths of the retaining attorney’s case, or even the masked threat of him / her being so declared, combined with the opposition knowing the quality of the expert retained, leads to early settlement favorable to the retaining side. 
<br><br>
<strong>Adverse opinions</strong><br>
Moreover, a knowledge of strengths, risks and limitations can allow the attorneys more perspective as to when and whether to settle, whether to risk a court appearance and how to find answers to knotty areas—and there invariably are. Sometimes, the most valuable contributions of an expert are the behind the scenes medical discoveries that put the case into a perspective. This may ultimately save or harness a fortune in civil litigation. 
<br><br>
Not all opinions are favorable. Yet, one should never project from one case to another because they happen to be broadly on the same issue. Each case has its strengths and weaknesses and the expert’s role is to show the retaining counsel the best legal decisions to make based on the available medical information. 
<br><br>
Almost every case that is complex enough to involve an expert consultant (as opposed to a medical practitioner’s whose opinion is so obvious it is not opposed) has two sides to it. 
<br><br>
I was recently approached about a case involving a specific supplement. The plaintiff attorney was most shocked to discover that both plaintiff had on separate occasions retained me and defense counsels in such cases.
<br><br> 
“How could you?” She asked.
<br><br> 
I explained that if cases were so clear cut she would not need an expert in the first place. 
All I could do is find the strengths and limitations of her case. And commonly in the first minutes talking to an attorney, I will have a general impression of strengths and limitations of a particular case and may convey that. Then examining the notes will give me more perspective. 
<br><br>
Either way, a note review is legitimate and valuable. In civil actions, a plaintiff initially may be saved $50,000 on a case (s)he would later lose. And a defendant may understand more the need to negotiate when medical evidence is unfavorable. 
On the other hand, counsel may seek another expert, but the initial objective advice still stands. 
<br><br>
<strong>Time Allocation Before Deposition</strong><br>
Expert testimony begins at the discovery deposition. Planning must go into this. 
How much does the retaining attorney want the expert to prepare? Should (s)he enter the deposition unprepared without re-reviewing the notes? If so (s)he may be compromising his / her opinion there, and his / her court testimony will ultimately suffer. Sometimes preparation can be limited to an hour or two if the expert is going to testify purely as to his / her medical findings. This is far more limiting than an expert expressing key opinions in his / her expertise area but which encompassed information retrieved from comprehensive reviews. Such a detailed deposition in my experience generally takes 2 to 4 hours at minimum (and at maximum, in one instance, went on for several days!). 
<br><br>
Clearly in these instances, the medical expert should spend several hours preparing the information (s)he has already studied, as well as be up to date with the cogent research. If the expert has made appropriate notes before (s)he may be able to synthesize information that took 15 hours to review initially into two to four hours of preparation. But that preparation not properly done can make or break the case. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
Adequate early planning and feedback from your medical expert often impacts case outcome. Allow your expert to be your critical but objective partner, who may see the half empty glass as half full but give you clues how to handle the half empty components.<br><br>
<h1>The Discovery Deposition: </h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 5 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Vernon M. Neppe MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DDFAPA*</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>The active process continues</strong></br>
The discovery deposition could be the most neglected area of overall case evaluation for the retaining attorneys. 
Retaining attorneys may spend a very necessary hour with the witness before the deposition but such limited interaction may be insufficient for what should be an active process. There should be an active predeposition phase followed by a well-planned deposition period.
<br><br>
<strong>The predeposition phase</strong></br>
The retaining attorney, if necessary, needs to educate his / her expert about the appropriate style to adopt during discovery deposition. This should not be necessary with an experienced forensic expert who will be aware of the pitfalls of such a deposition. 
<br><br>
The balance for the expert, after discussion with his retaining counsel, is to ensure that the key information (s)he wants to mention at trial will not be eliminated.
 <br><br>
This usually means (s)he should cover this data or mention it at deposition. If necessary, he will bring up these issues at deposition. 
<br><br>
The exceptions would be if (s)he had mentioned the information before that time, e.g. a previously discovered letter by the expert or a properly worded declaration may serve this purpose. In those instances, if the discovering attorney does not cover those areas, (s)he will have to accept the disadvantage of hearing testimony on them at trial, without knowing exactly the experts points. Similarly, if an expert has been specifically declared, as dealing with a specific issue and this is not covered, this then becomes the discovering attorney’s problem. But the latter may, nevertheless, dispute that it was raised at deposition and is not admissible, and often a fine line may decide admissibility of such information. 
<br><br>
<strong>Expert witness style during the discovery deposition</strong><br> 
The retaining attorney must understand the expert may testify very differently at deposition than at trial. At deposition, the expert may show a rather labored, detailed style of checking all information. He may not volunteer information. At trial, he should not need to check the information given by his retaining counsel as he should be familiar with it and he may give spontaneous opinions and use metaphors to help the jury. 
<br><br>
However, sometimes at discovery deposition, the expert may in fact make important points voluntarily, effectively scoring home runs, knowing the case is likely to be settled. Clearly, this strategy needs to be pre-decided by the retaining counsel. Consequently, the style of the same expert consultant may vary considerably. 
<br><br>
The opposing attorney will try to ensure some information not be admissible because this is not being asked at deposition. It is the retaining attorney’s task to ensure this will not happen. 
On the other hand, the latter does not want areas that have not been brought up to be mentioned, but which have definitely been established as appropriate material for the expert to discuss in court, because that gives him / her a major advantage in court. 
<br><br>
The retaining attorney, wisely, may rarely ask questions during discovery deposition cross-examination, but at times, interventions are necessary. In Obstetric Medicine, the concept of “masterly inactivity” allows the obstetrician to observe and allow nature to take its course during the delivery of a baby; but if there are complications, immediate intervention is available. Masterly inactivity should be role of the vigilant retaining attorney.
<br><br>
<strong>Unmentioned issues</strong></br>
Sometimes, because the expert had not mentioned something (s)he should have mentioned during his / her deposition, motions to exclude may lead to excluded evidence. Alternatively, the issue may not have been brought up deliberately by the discovering attorney so that (s)he can spring it on the expert consultant at trial, during cross-examination, or via a motion to the judge. 
Sometimes, the information is just not available in time for deposition. 
<br><br>
The retaining counsel should ensure that the medical expert should know that (s)he will never admit at deposition that (s)he has expressed all the opinions (s)he will express at trial. When asked about articles (s)he will indicate ongoing knowledge, and when not asked about areas, instead of cuing the deposing attorney, (s)he may just indicate that there are “twenty inches of notes, plus a patient examination here. We have not covered all areas and I may, if asked to do so, express an opinion at trial on something we’ve not covered.” When asked for examples, the expert may point to all the notes, and the whole body of knowledge in the literature, though (s)he must concede that (s)he will let his / her retaining attorney know if his / her opinion has changed as a consequence. 
<br><br>
There is a fine balance, in this regard, often answered by various techniques by the retaining counsel. 
An occasional legitimate technique is for the retaining side to argue that the deposition is incomplete, or that it has gone so much over time that they have not had the opportunity to ask about key features on cross examination. At trial, if the opposing attorney objects that the specific issue was not discussed at deposition, the responses may still be admissible because the opposite attorney did not discover that information. It is no-one’s fault but his / her own. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, the expert consultant may not have data, articles, X-rays, tests or copies of reports available. (S)He may potentially be appropriately excluded unless the expert indicates his / her intention to evaluate such data, and to convey his / her findings on such information to the attorneys if it changes his / her opinion, or to, if necessary be deposed again. 
There are limitations to such approaches if the information could have been provided before that time, and the expert legitimately could have been provided with it. On the other hand, (s)he could not expect to comment on exhibits discovered after his / her deposition. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong></br>
Adequate planning and strategies are necessary for discovery depositions. It is at that point that the regular season really begins. The trial itself or mediation or settlement is the playoffs.<br><br>
<h1>Preparing For Court Testimony: The Early Phase:</h1>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>Testimony begins long before the trial</strong><br>
The expert consultant does not become inactive waiting for his / her trial testimony after the deposition is over. There is plenty interchange that should be taking place with the legal team.
<br><br>
<strong>Trial or settlement?</strong><br>
Trial testimony begins before trial with the decision as to which witnesses to call, and, in fact, whether settlement of the case beforehand may not be appropriate. 
Up until the moment the expert testifies the case may suddenly be settled. Similarly, decisions to prevent a court hearing via arbitration or mediation may be made. In these instances, the expert’s opinion may be critical. Opposing counsel information at mediation, for example, may be medically inaccurate. If settlement does not occur, the extra knowledge of ammunition to be used may become valuable, even if any written mediation information could not be used in court as exhibits. 
<br><br>
<strong>Witness experience in testifying</strong><br>
You must know the strengths and limitations of your expert. For example:<br>
What is his / her expertise in court?<br>
What is his / her expertise in public speaking?<br>
What is his / her expertise in thinking on his / her feet?<br>
<br><br>
Unless you know your expert’s strengths and limitations, you cannot adequately prepare your case. 
<br><br>
Stylistically, experts vary. Personally, I am very different in deposition compared with trial. In deposition, I may be careful about compound questions. 
At trial, I know what is going to be asked. 
It is important for the attorney to know this, otherwise (s)he may think his / her expert is the verbose, detailed, pernickety individual the discovery attorney encountered in deposition.
<br><br>
<strong>What retaining counsel should ensure</strong><br>
Clearly the expert consultant should not be compromised in any way and his / her knowledge and information about specifics maximized, so the legitimacy of his / her court testimony can be improved. 
<br><br>
1.	Make sure your experts have examined the patient. Sometimes this is impossible—the patient is dead. At other times, the examination is not relevant: for example, the critical patient injury occurred years before and the retrospective data obtained during examination may no longer be relevant in the tort.<br><br> 
2.	Alternatively, the patient may be so profoundly demented that real communication is impossible and visualization of an adequate videotaped assessment may be adequate for evaluation instead of live physical examination. <br><br>
3.	Make sure your experts have interviewed key people, even if only briefly, such as spouse or family members or employers or co-employees or relevant health professionals like nurses or doctors, so that (s)he can obtain an adequate perspective in relation to the patient’s function. The attorney may need to compose a key interview list. However, (s)he must ensure that such interviews are purely information gathering, so that the other side cannot effectively claim that the witness was unduly or inappropriately influence during the interview.<br><br>
4.	Make sure your expert knows exactly how (s)he has been declared and the range of his / her testimony. <br><br>
5.	 Ensure that the expert does not exceed his / her expertise such that a jury will want to discard even his / her opinions in his / her areas of expertise. Sometimes (s)he may testify as an expert but indicate that (s)he is only qualified to do so in the context of his / her specialty (the family practitioner may express medical opinions despite not being a specialist in the area, but frequently defers to the specialist). <br><br>
6.	At times, such testimony may be particularly valuable (e.g. expected standard of care in a malpractice case) indicating the specific knowledge or skills peers.<br><br>
<br><br>
These are the obvious areas. The following are far subtler, despite being at times invaluable:<br><br>
•	Make sure your expert is prepared to, at least, prepare a short rough draft to assist in concretizing his / her ideas. The draft may or may not be sent to anyone. Sometimes such a draft is telegraphic, so that even if discoverable, it will not mean much to anyone else.<br><br>
•	Make sure the expert creates a list of key points that (s)he feels may strengthen the case that (s)he is prepared to testify about. This is the most commonly neglected facet of adequate preparation. <br><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
You should not leave issues open until just before testimony. Adequate planning beginning a month earlier will allow for a successful transition to the time of storm and stress: Just before trial and the trial itself.<br><br>
<h1>Medical Court Testimony: The Plan of Attack:</h1>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>The trial begins earlier than the trial</strong><br>
It is just before testimony and there are many issues you have to deal with. Time is short, so is sleep. And you want to make sure your expert is as adequately prepared as he can be. Preparation of the expert for trial is like ensuring the athlete is ready for the real game. Even though most cases settle before testimony is necessary, proper preparation as if the expert is going to testify can set the attorney up to reach a better settlement.
<br><br>
<strong>Time preparation beforehand</strong><br>
The most common difficulty may be neglecting your witness before trial. Make sure the expert knows how (s)he has been declared. The limits should be discussed carefully with the witness. And make sure your expert is actively preparing. You may need to be teaching, if necessary too!
<br><br>
The following elements are relevant:
The expert consultant should have composed all notes and summarized key points. 
(S)he must know the key points (s)he plans to make, and any key admissions or comments made at discovery. 
<br><br>
<strong>Teaching the expert how to avoid pitfalls</strong><br>
The attorney needs to ensure that the expert understands the tricks that the other attorney may use. 
He needs to teach the expert, if necessary. 
This should be a given, but many “expert consultants” are not experts in the medicolegal side, though they know a great deal about their expertise. 
These are examples of pitfalls that the expert should be aware of during cross-examination:
<br><br>
1.	The compound question. <br><br>
2.	The hypothetical question. <br><br>
3.	The non-differentiation of quantified information which may or may not require standardized testing. For example, history-taking is often amplified indirectly via written or computerized questionnaires : This is a legitimate clinical data acquisition technique, though not standardized for a population. <br><br>
	In contrast, many psychological tests require sample comparisons and specific standardized norms or even percentile scores, because individual responses are based on how others of the same age, sex and demographics would respond.<br><br>
4.	The demonstration to the jury of all the negative data in the evaluation (if defense) or positive data (if plaintiff). Prioritizing is critical. <br><br>
5.	The taking the expert out of his / her area of expertise. <br><br>
6.	The minimal misquoting of information. <br><br>
7.	The misinterpretation of data. <br><br>
8.	The attempt to effectively allow another witness to testify by quoting him. <br><br>
9.	The consolidation of the other side’s witness by making him / her sound great by the expert. <br><br>
10.	 The quoting of something said by the expert that contradicts what (s)he may be arguing. <br><br>
11.	 The use of wrong time periods based on general questions. The global quoting of a result without taking specifics into account. <br><br>

<strong>Before testimony</strong><br>
Allow the expert the opportunity to suggest key areas to concentrate on during testimony. Give him / her opportunities to ask about limitations in the case and therefore modify those questions. 
 Ensure that the expert has had a trial run with the questions composed by the attorney. (S)He may want to have these questions audio taped and answer each in turn recording and testing his / her answers, or tell them to friends who play the role of a mock jury. 
(S)He should be allowed time to discuss his / her results and difficulties with the attorney thereafter. 
Know that the other side will try to compromise your witness using the strongest possible area of weakness: Anticipate the limitations of your case. 
Similarly, allow the expert point out to the attorney highlights of his / her background for later amplification.commonly, attorneys may think they have the key facts, but the wood may be missed from the trees. The greater the expertise, the more important this fact. 
<br><br>
<strong>Planning for the court trial</strong><br>
It is often useful or critical to call the expert the night before or see him / her briefly at court pre-testimony. (S)He can be updated of events or possible new questions. 
Knowing exactly when the expert will testify is critical. The expert is expensive and delays can increase costs enormously. Sometimes this is beyond the attorney’s control but the best possible estimate should be made to save the expert time and you money. 
The expert may use a computer or video or slides may have been prepared. The court should know about these in advance, if necessary. 
One must always be aware to adequately give your expert appropriate time. If you feel (s)he needs 2 hours, ensure that (s)he has 4 hours. If the testimony takes less time, have another fact witness waiting so that the trial can continue. 
Take into account lunch breaks of possibly 1 1/2 hours, tea breaks of what may end up to be 15 or 20 minutes and a string of requests to a judge to grant or not grant particular motions. Effectively 2 hours of evidence can easily mean 4 hours on the stand. If your expert is valuable enough (s)he must have that period of time otherwise you may be wasting him. Give him / her the chance to shine, and to communicate with the jury and form a bond with them. 
<br><br>
<strong>Establish principles of how to communicate</strong><br>
The attorney must know how to pick up signs from the expert that say “Move elsewhere” or “let me amplify” or “Ask me about this cross-examination question in Redirect examination”. 
This area is frequently neglected. Often it just means listening to words, or body language. A discussion before testimony may allow understanding of special questions to ask or not ask during testimony. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
Games are not usually decided in the bottom of the ninth. The playoffs began pre-trial and these are the early innings. Besides anything, adequate preparation allows you the confidence to enter the later stages of the game and pitch flawlessly.<br><br>
<h1>The Direct Examination of a Medical Expert: </h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 8 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>
<strong>Vernon M. Neppe MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DDFAPA*</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>The key to success</strong><br>
Your expert has come this far. You know the points (s)he wants to make. Let him her make them. And if something has come up that needs emphasis, ensure (s)he speaks to that as well. And if you want to eliminate issues ensure (s)he knows about it.
<br><br>
<strong>Build up your expert</strong><br>
Always build up your expert’s credibility. It is insufficient to just demonstrate to the jury (s)he is an expert in the field. 
<br><br>
If you are able you must demonstrate two other key facts:<br>
1.	Your expert is actually much better than the other side’s comparative witness. This may mean asking questions which can then be asked when cross-examining the other side’s expert to demonstrate, for example, membership of a group, significant honors or great experience. <br><br>
2.	This means adequate pretrial preparation so the contrast can go smoothly. On the other hand, you may want to diminish this side knowing your expert may not be as good or as expert. But this also needs exact planning so as to present your expert in the best light possible. <br><br>
3.	You should demonstrate your expert’s significant expertise such that (s)he has profound credibility with the jury. <br><br>
4.	This process may take ten or more minutes, if necessary. It is all preparation for the key points. It is time well spent.<br><br>

The most effective approach is to initially impressively introduce the expert; then during his / her answering of questions, emphasize his / her special skills relating to the relevant issue being discussed. A simplistic example: “Doctor, you’re also a psychiatrist” “Yes” and “And psychiatrists specialize in areas such as depression and anxiety” “Yes” “And this is what you have described here” “Yes”. 
This way the biography takes less time and there is emphasis of the expert’s expertise in the areas of relevance.
<br><br>
<strong>The key issues</strong><br>
Don’t lose sight of the cardinal issues the expert wants to make.
You may want to identify key points to the jury by asking your witness:
Do you think this is very relevant in this case?
Why?
This grounds the jury. 
<br><br>
Be prepared to always focus on the key issue of what happened and why. How can the expert defend this? How can you attack another issue? How can the attorney use the expert in that regard? How can the expert play aggressive chess and subtly indicate the limitations of the opposing expert or experts?
<br><br>
Use your expert specifically in his / her key area of expertise. If you take him / her out of his / her key area of expertise, you know that the opposition will pounce on this. You are not board certified in this area, you are not a specialist in this area. This may lead to compromises of how much the jury believes the expert even in his / her real area of expertise. To make the expert extremely broad e.g. to make a neurologist or psychiatrist into a neuroradiologist, can sometimes work because they can argue they see MRI films. On the other hand, they must be prepared to express their limitations. 

<strong>Errors to avoid during Direct Examination</strong><br>
The retaining attorney should never get caught up on a particular test. (S)He should realize that a medical expert is basing his / her opinion on everything that (s)he has received on the history, on the examination, on the special investigation and on the loads of data, that (s)he may have been sent relating to the particular patient. The only time the retaining attorney should focus on a particular test is to score a home run. For example, DNA evidence might be quite definitive or a specific radiological X-ray or MRI evidence may be extremely important, particularly as juries will respond visually to such information. 
On the other hand, it is rare for a psychological test such as the MMPI, to be critically important enough to focus on. It will only bore the jury. Instead broader questions pertaining to personality function may be asked. 
<br><br>
Similarly to focus on a particular complex symptom or condition that is not highly relevant, and that the jury cannot understand, may be self-defeating. The attorney should not be asking about the key features of “dyspraxia”, but if he/ she did, the expert could say “this is complex concept, but it is important simply because it may reflect other practical difficulties in the function of the brain.” The attorney can then focus on the relevant impaired functions from that part of the brain, and the expert would tell the jury about the problems the patient experiences, as a consequence. When asked how that information was derived, the expert may mention briefly that one of the features was that the patient had exhibited that special kind of dyspraxia, which cued him in to the particular kinds of malfunction. 
He would use simple phrases like “this is what the patient has difficulty doing …”. “This is why I say this ….” . “This will impact in the following ways…”. “This is how it can be solved …”. This is attorney—expert teamwork at its best. And also reflects the preplanning that goes into a good symphony!
<br><br>
<strong>The jurors</strong><br>
Obviously you have told the expert to directly address the jury. And each expert has his style.
<br><br>
The expert may at times be brief. But you should allow him / her to communicate little TV shorts of thirty seconds sometimes to a minute at a time, getting across his / her point to the jury, sometimes using a metaphor. However, where possible, the expert should let the retaining attorney know which metaphors will be used as otherwise an excellent comparison can fail because of lack of communication. On the other hand, the expert still should be allowed the spontaneity that goes with persuasive thinking on his / her feet. It is his / her job to give the jury a sense of priorities, of understanding and of perspective. 
<br><br>
I personally like to give jurors metaphors they can understand. I like to engage the jury. I then subtly follow through and indicate why they should accept my expert opinion on it. I sometimes even find that actually telling juries that they may get conflicting opinions helps them resolve issues. But again, team-work is always useful when it can be done, and prepared metaphors allow the attorney-expert dyad to work in tandem.
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
The direct examination is where many cases have been won and lost. A bad expert may not only destroy the expert testimony but compromise your whole case to the jury. A good expert gives you several runs lead for the final onslaught on the expert: The cross examination in the ninth inning.<br><br>
<h1>The Cross and Redirect Examination of the Expert:</h1> 
<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 9 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>The cross examination challenge</strong><br>
The key to successful testimony is appropriately getting through the cross-examination. 
The cross examination in trial is the most stressful and challenging period for the expert. Preparation is more difficult because there is an aggressive pitcher probing at the expert’s weaknesses and points. But there are ways to optimize this experience. 
If the retaining attorney has does his or her job well during direct examination, much of the thunder would have already been taken out of the cross examination.
<br><br>
<strong>The attack</strong><br>
An early area for the cross-examining counsel to attack, particularly if the witness’s evidence is cogent, legitimate and powerful, is to use the ad hominem argument — attack the expert’s credentials. This is, of course, dangerous for both sides:<br>
The cross-examining attorney has to be very subtle otherwise the jury may be turned against him. <br>
On the other hand, sometimes the opposition attorney may feel (s)he can destroy the witness by such an action. Invariably areas of witness vulnerability should have been discussed beforehand so that the retaining attorney knows in which ways the responses can be appropriately handled during re-direct examination. Often, the apparent limitation can be turned into a virtue: The expert may very much rebut the cross-examiner; or during redirect examination, (s)he may be given the opportunity to be portrayed as better or more competent than other experts on the opposite side, who may be expressing contrary opinions. Clearly, these are difficult goals. And clearly the redirect attorney should have checked any such key information elicited during the discovery deposition and planned optimal responses. 
<br><br>
The attorney and the expert both have to be aware of what is happening at cross-examination. 
The expert’s answers are often short and not directed towards the jury.<br> 
If a particular test is brought up, the expert might begin to indicate that the test is not valid or appropriate for a particular reason even if his / her response is thrown out as not directly answering the question. But this cues the retaining attorney. <br>
Or (s)he may just by looking at his / her attorney directly or nodding indicate “ask me more on this.”<br>
Baseball has signs. A skilled witness can communicate with his / her attorney. But signs must be understood. 
<br><br>
During the cross-examination, the opposing attorney may be focusing on the normal findings or the abnormal findings of an irrelevant test, knowing the jury does not really have the skill or knowledge to discriminate for relevance. In return, the expert may wish to request source documents. This slows down the cross examination considerably and may even not allow the other side to complete their questioning. 
<br><br>
The expert’s responses to an attack rather than the answers he or she gives may be the key element of successfully controlling the cross-examination. An easy, straightforward approach without being ruffled may negate a violent cross examiners attack. 
<br><br>
Many attorneys teach their experts how to face the jury. The expert will not usually be looking at the jury during the redirect examination, unless (s)he scores a home run. But the expert will be communicating in a subtle way with his / her attorney, effectively asking him / her to tell more. 
<br><br>
<strong>The attorney listener</strong><br>
All the while during the cross examination, the retaining counsel is listening carefully. Often the expert may not fully appreciate the line of questioning of the opposing counsel. The expert is not an attorney. Nor is he aware of all the preceding issues and anticipated points to be made. It is here that the retaining attorney is at his most active, preparing for redirect examination.
<br><br>
<strong>Redirect examination</strong><br>
It is key to give your expert the opportunity to respond to the cross-examination by the retaining attorney adequately re-directing the examination. If this is an open question like “in summary…” or “do you have other points to mention”, the judge may not allow the line of questioning. 
<br><br>
It is vital to have enough confidence in your expert to give him / her the opportunity to answer questions that you may not have come up with. 
One technique would be: “Doctor you were asked about X, I note you were asked just to give a yes or no answer. It seemed you wanted to put your answer in perspective. Would you please clarify exactly what you meant.” Sometimes one can be a little more nonspecific. “I note that for A, B, C and D, you were asked for yes or no answers. Did you feel that you adequately portrayed your answer just by yes or no?” And if the expert answers no, then say “would you please explain.” This way the expert is given the opportunity to counter areas that the attorney, who is not a medical doctor, may not even realize. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
The cross examination in the bottom of the ninth is the most stressful and carefully constructed element in the whole lengthy expert process. But you are not passively involved. There is a tenth inning that is often needed and you must ensure that the home runs make your preparation for the win stick. <br><br>
