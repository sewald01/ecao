<strong><i>How Attorneys Can Best Utilize Their Medical Expert Consultant:<br>A Medical Expert’s Perspective: Part 4 of a Monograph.*</i></strong><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong>The partnership</strong><br>
Your medical expert is your partner in the case. The difference is (s)he is going to give you an honest appraisal. You should aim to maximize information and opinions given. You must evaluate how even adverse opinions can be incorporated into your case. You need a devil’s advocate because your opposition counsel will play that role!
On the other hand, there are always subtle differences of procedure in various jurisdiction and even between courts and judges of the same jurisdiction: The attorney needs to know his battle turf, and pick up local rules and practices and be able to warn the expert of particular local pitfalls.
<br><br>
<strong>Early consultations</strong><br>
Plan to use your expert in his / her key area of expertise. If you take him / her out of his / her key area of expertise, his / her opinion may not reflect an accurate perspective of the case. This may cause the expert to misinterpret his / her information and may mislead the retaining counsel. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, expressing incorrect opinions may compromise the value of the expert to a judge, jury and the opposing counsel who may use him / her for cannon fodder and generalize their ostensible disdain to the whole case. To make the expert extremely broad e.g. to make a neurologist or psychiatrist into a neuroradiologist, can sometimes work because they can argue they see MRI films. 
On the other hand, to make a neuropsychologist into a neuropsychiatrist may well fail the test of adequate opinions of all the areas impacting the case including pharmacological interventions. The expert must recognize his / her limitations when advising his / her client. 
<br><br>
To get the most out of the expert it is highly preferable that the expert be consulted early. This way any adverse opinions that are severely dissonant with the opinions the attorney is seeking may lead to abandoning the first expert and using another instead. 
However, consonant ideas may be fashioned so strongly in a letter, that early settlement of the case may result. 
Sometimes, the expert’s explaining of the strengths of the retaining attorney’s case, or even the masked threat of him / her being so declared, combined with the opposition knowing the quality of the expert retained, leads to early settlement favorable to the retaining side. 
<br><br>
<strong>Adverse opinions</strong><br>
Moreover, a knowledge of strengths, risks and limitations can allow the attorneys more perspective as to when and whether to settle, whether to risk a court appearance and how to find answers to knotty areas—and there invariably are. Sometimes, the most valuable contributions of an expert are the behind the scenes medical discoveries that put the case into a perspective. This may ultimately save or harness a fortune in civil litigation. 
<br><br>
Not all opinions are favorable. Yet, one should never project from one case to another because they happen to be broadly on the same issue. Each case has its strengths and weaknesses and the expert’s role is to show the retaining counsel the best legal decisions to make based on the available medical information. 
<br><br>
Almost every case that is complex enough to involve an expert consultant (as opposed to a medical practitioner’s whose opinion is so obvious it is not opposed) has two sides to it. 
<br><br>
I was recently approached about a case involving a specific supplement. The plaintiff attorney was most shocked to discover that both plaintiff had on separate occasions retained me and defense counsels in such cases.
<br><br> 
“How could you?” She asked.
<br><br> 
I explained that if cases were so clear cut she would not need an expert in the first place. 
All I could do is find the strengths and limitations of her case. And commonly in the first minutes talking to an attorney, I will have a general impression of strengths and limitations of a particular case and may convey that. Then examining the notes will give me more perspective. 
<br><br>
Either way, a note review is legitimate and valuable. In civil actions, a plaintiff initially may be saved $50,000 on a case (s)he would later lose. And a defendant may understand more the need to negotiate when medical evidence is unfavorable. 
On the other hand, counsel may seek another expert, but the initial objective advice still stands. 
<br><br>
<strong>Time Allocation Before Deposition</strong><br>
Expert testimony begins at the discovery deposition. Planning must go into this. 
How much does the retaining attorney want the expert to prepare? Should (s)he enter the deposition unprepared without re-reviewing the notes? If so (s)he may be compromising his / her opinion there, and his / her court testimony will ultimately suffer. Sometimes preparation can be limited to an hour or two if the expert is going to testify purely as to his / her medical findings. This is far more limiting than an expert expressing key opinions in his / her expertise area but which encompassed information retrieved from comprehensive reviews. Such a detailed deposition in my experience generally takes 2 to 4 hours at minimum (and at maximum, in one instance, went on for several days!). 
<br><br>
Clearly in these instances, the medical expert should spend several hours preparing the information (s)he has already studied, as well as be up to date with the cogent research. If the expert has made appropriate notes before (s)he may be able to synthesize information that took 15 hours to review initially into two to four hours of preparation. But that preparation not properly done can make or break the case. 
<br><br>
<strong>Essence</strong><br>
Adequate early planning and feedback from your medical expert often impacts case outcome. Allow your expert to be your critical but objective partner, who may see the half empty glass as half full but give you clues how to handle the half empty components.<br><br>
