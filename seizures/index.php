<h3>Welcome to our special "epilepsy, seizures and spells" page. This is an extremely complicated area. We will provide links below to look at a variety of variants of seizure disorders including classifications and pseudoseizure disorders as well as more formal ideas of temporal lobe symptoms.</h3>

<p>But first we want to tell you about one of the most valued books ever on this topic. <a href="http://www.pni.org/clinical/briefneppebio.htm">Dr. Vernon Neppe</a> has written a book devoting aspects several chapters to this area in his highly esteemed and very important book on brain
medications and ethical dilemmas, <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm">Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope</a>.</p> 
<p>Dr. Neppe's approach to Seizure disorders is extraordinarily relevant because he approaches them from the context of the Neuropsychiatrist and Psychopharmacologist. The book is so important because you are actually able to "live" through  consultations  with the specialist doctor; you are able to learn from one of the world's foremost experts in the interface area of seizures, unusual or atypical spells, rapid mood disturbances, agression and irritability, and psychiatric disorder.  The most important parts of the book are the principles. But don't just believe this. Please read below:</p>

<p>"Dr. Vernon Neppe has written one of the most important works dealing with 
  brain medications and social dilemmas ever penned. This book has helped me understand 
  that I am not alone, and that there is hope for a complete recovery. Dr. Neppe 
  has the rare ability to view his patients with both clinical detachment as well 
  as human beings, with fears, anguish, worry, terror and everything in between. 
  This wonderful volume should be required reading for anyone with curiosity or 
  concerns. "Cry The Beloved Mind" will change more than minds; it will change 
  LIVES!" <em>Karen</em><br><br>

<p>In the context of seizures and related conditions, there are five special chapters on seizure disorders,  EEGs,  psychiatric elements, explosions in the brain and even how a suicidal patient with aypical spells was helped. And each chapter is written for the layperson aiming at educating through fascination.</p>

<p>Here is the beginnings of one of these chapters for reading: <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/excerpts_ch02.php">Chapter 2: More is Better?</a></p>
-->
<p>Of course, we've already learnt about many other areas like <em>Drug interactions.</em> 
  As Marilyn, non-patient reader, eloquently puts it: "<em>Unbelievable, but this book makes us actually want to read about absorption, metabolism, 
distribution and elimination of medications!</em>" You may want to 
  understand about some of the basic aspects. We understand about the interactions 
  of cigarette smoke, the problems with jet lag, and even the role of Vitamin 
  B6. We are taken through analogies like boats and bathtubs and of course, coffee 
and caffeine in anxiety.</p>
<p>And you will learn about <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/anxietydepression/">depression and many other conditions</a>. But if you want to learn more about Cry the Beloved Mind and it's overall perspective, 
  go to our <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com">home page</a> --it is the featured 
  book--or if you want to order the book--author autographed and now the only source 
  for it--<a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/shop/catalog">click here</a>. 
  Or just click the link, if you want to go directly to more information on <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/shop/catalog">Cry 
  the Beloved Mind</a>. But how does the book read? Easily? Well, try it, and 
  here is a chapter on depression to boot: <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/excerpts_ch11.php">The 
  beginnings of Chapter 11</a> of Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope by Vernon 
  M Neppe MD, PhD. You can see this book is written in the special new literary genre of <a href="http://brainvoyage.com/sciction/index.php">sciction 
  - science through literature</a>. It "educates by fascination." And this just may be a reason why the author autographed 
book may become a <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/autographed.php">collector's item</a>.</p>
<h4>What readers have regarded as a "<em>must get</em>." As a reader says about these sections after reading the book:</h4>

<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tr><td bgcolor="#E6EEFB">
<p>"WONDERFUL BOOK, EASY READ. No longer do you have to feel different or 
  alone in a world without hope or answers. This book gives the reader a great 
  deal of insight on mental health conditions and the different kinds of medications 
  used to treat them. I think anyone suffering from a mental condition, such as 
  depression will benefit from this book. As you read through the many different 
  chapters I am sure you will find somewhere or someone you will identify with 
  or see yourself in. It made me feel I wasn't the only one in the world on medications 
  for depression or a seizure related condition. I felt compelled to keep reading 
  and reading until I finished the book. I came away with a better understanding 
  of my own treatment and the way medications work in the treatment of these illnesses. 
  I would recommend this book to anyone who is suffering from a mental condition 
  or family and friends of anyone suffering from a mental condition. Dr. Neppe 
  has been able to bring this book down to a level that is easy to understand 
  and read, and at the same time is encouraging and yes, very 'HOPEFUL'." <em>Cindy, BarnesandNoble.com review</em></p> 

<p><a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/comments.php">Read the others thoughts, 
  too</a>, because this opinion is the common one. <em>We have yet to have someone 
  not finding this book valuable!</em> 
  <!--Again, if you want to learn more on Cry the 
  Beloved Mind and its overall perspective, go to our <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com">home 
  page</a> as it is the featured book! Enjoy!'--></p>

<h3>What are the Key Features of Seizure Disorders?</h3>  
<p>Here are some remarkable links for your interest from Dr. Vernon Neppe's website the <a href="http://www.pni.org">Pacific Neuropsychiatric Institute</a>.  The author: Dr. Neppe himself: But this is more technical, of course, for colleagues—although incidentally colleagues have found Dr. Neppe's book enormously helpful. See below:</p>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tr><td bgcolor="#E6EEFB">
 <p>"<strong>This should be essential reading for psychology students</strong>. It would certainly have made my life much easier, if I had available such a readable way to be educated. The unique case histories and focus on social and medical issues make the book very important." <em>Glenn Goodwin, PhD, Neuropsychologist</em></p> 
  
<p>"<strong>This book takes us to the core of what Medicine is about: to listen to what the patient is saying, not only with their word, but with their acts and the cry of help that their mind is doing. Great job Dr. Neppe.</strong>" <em>Jose L. Guzman</em></p>   
 
<p>"<strong>Dr. Neppe demonstrates his international expertise with care and respect for patients</strong>. He conveys hope and valuable information for more than just the general reader. I learned a great deal." <em> Dale Sobotka, MD, Psychiatrist.</em></p>
