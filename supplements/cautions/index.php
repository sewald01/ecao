<h3>Cautions of using "nutraceuticals" or "diet supplements" or "any non-prescribed nutritional, diet or other supplements"</h3>
<h4>Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD</h4>
<p><b>Definitions: <br>
  </b>Many different terms are used for the numerous <i>over the counter medications 
  or supplements</i> that are commonly used.<br>
  Terms such as <i>diet supplements</i> are common when dieting is involved, but 
  also when some attempt to improve their health.<br>
  Additionally, such terms as <i>nutritional supplement</i>s or<i> nutraceutical</i>s 
  or <i>herbal medications</i> are at times used.<br>
  To simplify, in this document, I use the term <i>Alternative Medications</i>.<br>

  While you may find it useful to&nbsp; read the documents below on <i>Alternative 
  Medications (such as herbs, non-prescription chemicals and other diet supplements)</i> 
  and specific compounds, please understand that the ultimate choice as to whether 
  to take them is yours alone, and you, not your physician, assume full responsibility 
  for any choice (taking or not taking) and any consequences that result, now 
  and in the future. This is so, even in the context of your medical doctor assisting 
  you or guiding you in making that choice, as there is a great deal that is unknown 
  or contradictory and uncertain, in this area, and your physician &#8212;who 
  is usually not specifically trained in Alternative Medications &#8212;may not 
  necessarily know about the side effects and interactions and the preparations 
  &#8212;even the well-documented ones &#8212;of the specific Alternative Medications 
  you are taking, considering or may have taken. You may wish to independently 
  review the literature on the specific compounds you want to take, but in doing 
  so, please bear in mind that it may be difficult , if not impossible to obtain 
  all the pertinent information , with all the pros and cons, and such interpretations 
  of the literature may be best suited to experts in the area. You should nevertheless 
  endeavor to keep your physician current as to any medications and Alternative 
  Medications you are taking. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b><br>
  A major consideration of consulting your physician is to optimize the assessment 
  of your difficulties and manage your condition appropriately. Usually this involves 
  prescription of medications in the correct dosage and combinations. Today, it 
  is common for patients to be taking "Alternative Medications" or "Nutraceuticals" 
  such as herbs, mineral, vitamin, diet and synthetic chemical supplements with 
  prescribed medications. We recognize that these Alternative Medications may 
  be valuable drugs, but they also have their dangers, including when they are 
  taken with prescription medications. These are outlined below, as the choice 
  of <i>whether to take these Alternative Medications rests ultimately with the 
  patient,</i> not the physician. Physicians are not specialists in Alternative 
  Medications. </p>
<p>Alternative medicines using herbs like St. John&#8217;s wort, Echinaceae, Grape-seed 
  extract, Melatonin and Gingko biloba, and chemicals such as SAMe and glucosamine, 
  have become a significant practical option amongst patients. &nbsp;The growing 
  use of special "diet" drugs with numerous different compositions complicates 
  such aspects further.<br>
</p>
<p>Similarly, weight loss has become extremely important amongst many who are 
  over-weight. Many different herbal and over the counter formulas and nutritional 
  solutions are suggested. The lay public is bombarded with "information" which 
  may be disinformation.<br>
</p>
<p>Consequently, this section clarifies briefly, and incompletely, the difficulties 
  of taking such "Nutraceuticals". The term Nutraceutical is used synonymously 
  here with "Nutritional supplement" and this includes "Diet supplement" and is 
  therefore a group of&nbsp; Alternative medications </p>
<p>A significant proportion of patients consulting physicians may inquire about 
  or take Alternative Medicines, either alone or in addition to their current 
  medication. Sometimes these have therapeutic value, and at other times they 
  don't have therapeutic effects, but this does not mean to say they will not 
  work for other indications. The whole area needs scientific control and scrutiny 
  as well as empathic understanding. Studies on herbal products are not done using 
  the stringent criteria that regulatory bodies such as the American Food and 
  Drug Administration require prescription drugs to go through, nor do they go 
  through the same approval process. Many prescription medications derive originally 
  from plants, though today synthetic preparations are easier and often better. 
</p>
<p><i>The problems with Alternative Medications</i> <br>
  Because something is supposedly a "natural" substance, like a natural herb, 
  doesn't mean to say that it's completely harmless. Snake venom is natural. Herbs 
  have pharmacological activity. Herbal treatments and other alternative medications 
  such as synthetic chemicals may produce problems. This is not to say that there 
  may not be a therapeutic value to any specific Alternative Medication. It is 
  important always to weigh the risks with the benefits. The benefits may relate 
  to the potential value of the compound for any individual. Such benefits may 
  be based on research and clinical knowledge as well as the individual's specific 
  experience with the compound. The risks may similarly be based on accumulated 
  research, clinical and individual data, but can also be delineated below. </p>
<p>Below are several r<i>easons recommending caution when using Alternative Medications</i>. 
  There may be others, but these seem amongst the most cogent. There are many 
  cautions which we are aware of for the use of regular prescribed medications, 
  but these generally are listed in the package insert. There do not appear to 
  be FDA approved, regulated package inserts (equivalent to prescribed drugs) 
  available for Alternative Medications. However, please bear in mind that even 
  though these are general principles, this does not mean that any specific Alternative 
  Medication is necessarily bad. <i>The good may outweigh the bad.</i> </p>
<p><i>First, herbs and other Alternative Medications are not as well regulated 
  as prescription medications</i>. We often do not know about the purity of the 
  preparation, the consistency of batches of the same preparation, the correct 
  doses or their appropriate indications. These drugs may have potential pharmacological 
  effects, but are frequently inadequately studied. This may mean that they could 
  even be more risky than regular prescribed drugs because of their many unknowns, 
  impurities, degree of stability of batches, and other variabilities. </p>
<p><i>Second, Alternative Medications, such as herbal remedies are often not single 
  chemical preparations. </i>There usually is an active chemical inside them, 
  but we may not even know what it is. For example, there is still debate what 
  the active ingredient of St. John&#8217;s wort is. This creates a situation 
  where different chemicals, some unnecessary, may interact with each other. </p>
<p><i>Third, with some of these Alternative Medications, we're not even sure whether 
  a placebo </i>&#8212;a drug without therapeutic effect such as a sugar &#8212;<i>won't 
  not work as well</i>. This is because they have often not appropriately been 
  studied to demonstrate added therapeutic benefit over and above what placebo 
  would show. </p>
<p><i>Fourth, the Alternative Medication might have side effects due to the active 
  chemical compounds.</i> Common side effects may be irritation of the stomach, 
  sleepiness or anxiety. Not even vitamins are always safe. Some vitamins are 
  toxic in too high a dosage, like the fat-soluble ones, vitamin A and vitamin 
  E. The side effects may not be immediate or short-term: Instead, they may be 
  noted only after many years. </p>
<p><i>Fifth, side effects may not be due to the active chemical.</i> It may be 
  due to the vehicle &#8212;the wrapping around the drug &#8212;and not the herb 
  or prescription medication or vitamin itself. For example, even the apparently 
  innocuous drug, L-tryptophan (a component in foods such as milk) produced a 
  potentially fatal reaction probably because the vehicle produced an allergic 
  reaction. The vehicle can vary greatly from one preparation of the same medication 
  to another and might increase or decrease drug absorption. If the compound absorbs 
  too quickly, unpleasant side effects may occur because the blood level increases 
  precipitously. But if it is absorbed too slowly, it could cause nausea or diarrhea, 
  especially if the drug is not absorbed, and then the medication will not work 
  as well. Different parts of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved, a capsule 
  might be absorbed differently from a tablet, and a particular long-acting preparation 
  will vary from the shorter-acting one. We see these problems with prescription 
  medications as well, but the preparation is generally better controlled. </p>
<p><i>Sixth,</i> because the active ingredients of these herbal remedies are as 
  yet inadequately studied chemicals, <i>we do not know what interactions will 
  occur with other medications.</i> These could relate to absorption from the 
  stomach or other parts of the gastro-intestinal tract, as well as metabolism 
  in the liver, and sometimes even to binding of proteins. Moreover, foods may 
  be involved: For example, St. John&#8217;s wort may, theoretically, produce 
  a dangerous food reaction called the "tyramine effect" or another compound, 
  Gingko biloba, may, in practice, interact with anticoagulant medication like 
  Coumadin. </p>
<p>When taking Alternative Medications like herbs, irregularly, not on a daily 
  basis, at a different time from other medications, there may be reduced interactions 
  in absorption at the stomach level but there may still be some inconsistency 
  with absorption of regular prescribed medications. When taking Alternative Medications 
  regularly, at a regular time and under consistent conditions e.g. before meals, 
  any absorption interactions may be more consistent. However, interactions at 
  the liver level may occur in any event, and an increase or decrease or unchanged 
  levels of prescribed medications may result. Conversely, the Alternative Medications 
  may be altered, or there may be changes in absorption or effects. We are unaware 
  of how many vitamin, mineral, herbal products and synthetic chemicals are going 
  to interact with medications. Absorption and metabolism is also sometimes a 
  problem with regular prescribed medications. We are gradually building up a 
  body of knowledge, in this regard, but there are still numerous unknowns. </p>
<p><i>Seventh, often dosage of these Alternative Medications &#8212;non-prescription 
  drugs&#8212; is questionable</i>. For example, melatonin was marketed for sleep 
  at much too high a dosage &#8212;3 mg or 6 mg a day &#8212;when the physiologic 
  dose may be half a mg a day. The problem, however, is different absorptions 
  producing a question as to the correct individual dosage. :Different preparations 
  may vary enormously. </p>
<p><i>Eighth, it is possible that Alternative Medications may in some way change 
  the way some prescription drugs are working.</i> They may amplify some effects, 
  they may neutralize some effects or they may modify them: This can have adverse 
  consequences, so that specific prescription drugs may not work properly. </p>
<p><i>Ninth, it is possible that these Alternative Medications could cause problems 
  in pregnancy or during breast-feeding. </i>They have generally not been studied 
  in that regard. </p>
<p><i>Tenth, different tablets or capsules of the herbal remedy might have different 
  levels of the relevant active chemicals. </i>Even when those differences are 
  subtle, that might make a big difference. This is because there are less stringent 
  requirements than producing a prescription drug. </p>
<p><i>Finally, eleventh, we do not know whether even Alternative Medications like 
  a herb that has been demonstrated to have a therapeutic effect will maintain 
  that effect over time.</i> We also do not know whether chemical changes in one's 
  body or one's brain may not require habituation to the chemical even after it 
  has lost its effect. Your realistic choices about Alternative Medications: When 
  you take Alternative Medications, you should carefully and sensibly observe 
  the changes that are happening to you, and exhibit as much care and respect 
  towards potential problems as they would while taking a prescription medication. 
  The herbs you taking may ultimately be shown to be food or poison. </p>
<p><b>The following are general guidelines as to choice of action.</b> <br>
  1. A "safe" way to avoid interactions may be to avoid taking new Alternative 
  Medications with your prescription medications. However, this has the limitation 
  of not receiving any therapeutic value these Alternative Medications may have 
  in your particular case. <br>
  2. On the other hand, just stopping the Alternative Medication you are taking, 
  may result in withdrawal effects or loss of the therapeutic effects of these 
  drugs. If you choose to withdraw off these Alternative Medications, it sometimes 
  may be necessary to gradually taper over several weeks. However, every chemical 
  is different and such a taper may also run the risk of side effects and drug 
  interactions, and there are times when it may be preferable to go off the non-prescription 
  drug immediately. <br>
  3. Your third choice, may be to take the Alternative Medications in conjunction 
  with your current medical prescription drugs. In this instance, you do not to 
  lose the benefits that the non-prescription Alternative Medication drug provides 
  for you. However, this involves risk, including those listed above. You should 
  regard such compounds understanding there may be benefits and risks. </p>
<p>You are free to disregard the advice above. The choice as to whether to take 
  Alternative Medications is yours alone. We, medical practitioners, cannot take 
  responsibility for your taking them. We cannot guarantee the safety of any of 
  these alternative compounds, nor their potential drug interactions. Even when 
  medical doctors assist you or guide you in making that choice, you must understand 
  there is a great deal that is unknown or contradictory and uncertain, in this 
  area, and that your physician &#8212;who is not specifically trained in Alternative 
  Medications &#8212;may not necessarily know about the side effects and interactions 
  and the specific preparations &#8212;even the well-documented ones &#8212;of 
  the specific Alternative Medications you are taking, considering or may have 
  taken. You should nevertheless endeavor to keep your physician current as to 
  any medications and Alternative Medications, you are taking. </p>
