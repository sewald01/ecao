<p>14. DISCLAIMER AND
WARNING:&nbsp; Reading this book assumes that you have read this disclaimer.
Use of this book constitutes understanding and acceptance of the provisions
below. CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN ON ALL INFORMATION. DO NOT RELY ON THIS BOOK.
This book is not intended to provide medical consultation regarding the
diagnosis, management or treatment of any patient or condition, nor is
it intended as a substitute for the professional judgment of a physician
or other health care provider. The material in this book is presented as
opinion and should not be used as a manual for self-diagnosis or self-treatment.
Human error, different opinions and rapid changes in medical, pharmacological,
forensic or other scientific practice, including changes in medications,
dosage and diagnoses, make it mandatory for readers to consult other independent
sources of information such as package inserts of medication, as well as
psychiatric, neurological, medical and pharmacological textbooks. This
book is not a textbook. Factual information has been significantly modified
so that any resemblance of any specific patient, family member, colleague
or student in this book to any real individual is purely coincidental.
In addition, the patient portrayals in this book are disguised composites,
combining features of numerous symptoms and experiences into one or several
patients and providing confidentiality to individuals. Furthermore, this
book describes unique experiences which are not necessarily generalizable
to others with similar symptoms or the same conditions. It is possible
that readers may experience not hope but distress or could otherwise be
adversely affected by this book. Those who believe that this could occur
should not read it. Whereas, the publisher, author, and Brainvoyage.com
have taken care to provide useful information, they make
no warranties, either expressed or implied of fitness for any particular
purpose. Additionally, collectively or individually, they cannot be held
liable in any way , directly or indirectly, for any information made available,
nor omitted in this book, and are not responsible for any errors or any
consequences arising from the use of the information contained herein or
any consequent damages or liability, even if it has been advised that such
defect exists. No suggested test or procedure should be carried out unless
in the reader's judgment, its risk is justified. In any event, should any
such material or information prove to be inaccurate, traumatic or in any
way defective, the reader assumes the entire risk (including consequential
damages) of reading or relying on or in other ways obtaining such material.
Under no circumstances will the author, publisher or Brainvoyage
or any other individual or company linked with this book be liable or be
responsible for any injury and / or damage to persons or property as a
matter of products liability, negligence or otherwise, or from any use
or operation of any methods, instructions, ideas or products contained
in the material herein or resulting from reliance upon or response to anything
derived from this book.
