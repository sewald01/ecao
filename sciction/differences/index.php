<p>
      <strong>Literary genre of sciction</strong></p>

<p>Sciction is a new literary genre I developed in 1999. It was a borne  from necessity and first used in my book, Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of  Hope, and subsequently in my plays, Tomorrow the Earthquake and its  modification, Quakes. I originally defined sciction as &quot;science through  fiction&quot; and later modified it to &quot;science through literature&quot; so that  book-stores could more easily classify it under the broader genre of non-fiction.  One kind of sciction is medical sciction involving composite patients and  students, interacting with a medical professional, at times, in dialogic style  allowing for education through fascination. The idea of sciction has, no doubt,  been used before, but the genre was never before defined. Within it, I  introduced a new kind of sub-paragraphing, the &quot;conversagraph&quot;, which allows  for maintained communication on a specific theme but with enough difference to  require at least a separation such as a new line, yet not a new paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>Pamela Boal, Philosopher of the International Society for  Philosophical Enquiry:</strong><br>

      You are eminently readable, simple and  direct without being over simplified. Unfamiliar words are clear in context or  explained in a manner that does not interrupt the flow. You constantly give a  message of hope and above all make it clear that neuropsychiatric conditions  are medical problems just as much as bronchitis or measles. Whatever format you  use these are important factors if you wish to reach the interested lay person  such as myself.<br>
      <br>
      I have just one concern with your  composite patient, could the lay reader not think 'that can't be our Mary's  problem she didn't have that symptom' or do you make it clear that not all  patients with the same basic cause for their illness present with the entire  range of symptoms? That's probably a silly question but then the obvious is not  always obvious.</p>
<p>There have been a few British TV  presentations dealing with real climatic events, our heat wave and our great  storm, which have a similar format to Sciction, which I had labelled faction. I  think they worked well on all the levels you are aiming for. Yes I think  Sciction as a way of presenting scientific subjects to a wider audience has  great potential.</p>

            <strong>Faction (V Neppe)</strong><br>
      There is a significant difference between &quot;sciction&quot; and  &quot;faction&quot;.<br>
      The genre of faction generally refers to fiction text based on real  historical figures and actual events, woven together with fictitious  components. This means that one cannot easily differentiate real historical  data from fiction: Fact becomes intertwined with fiction making the education  element limited and even may distort knowledge for those seeking &quot;fact&quot;.</p>
<p>The genre of faction supposedly derives from Geoffrey of Monmouth in the  12th century, and in fact, the later historian, Holinshed mistakenly treated  Geoffrey of Monmouth's writings as historical truth.</p>
<p>The modern use of faction may have begun with Frederick Forsyth in his  1971 best-seller &quot;The Day Of The Jackal&quot;.</p>
<p>I don't like the word faction anyway because of the many other meanings  such as &quot;a party or group (as within a government) that is often contentious or  self-seeking&quot; and &quot;party spirit especially when marked by dissension&quot; but that  is another issue.</p>
<p>So essentially faction muddies truth and fiction and is used  particularly in a historical context. Sciction functions as a literary  educational tool, and is based particularly in the sciences, is non-fiction in  the context of scientific information. but the composite realities that  illustrate the theme so that it may live, are based on literature, and  therefore reflects mainly fiction in that names and faces and conversations are  not exact. But you can rely on the information as educational science.</p><p><strong>Science Fiction</strong><br>
      Sciction is very different from science fiction where the education is  not about current scientific facts but about futuristic notions of what science  could be. Science fiction is a broad subgroup of the genre of fiction involving  speculative science translated into fiction. It usually is creative and  imaginative reflecting elements not found in contemporary reality and may  include other genres like fantasy and horror.</p>

<p><strong>Conversagraph</strong><br>
      As for conversagraph: It's a literary technique I use frequently and I  believe valuably in many different contexts. I may be discussing several themes  which I separate by paragraphs. However, there are sub-themes that require  links within that paragraph-effectively sub-paragraphs. The examples given may  have appeared leaden, because I wanted them to be clear, but I can assure you  that I find the concept exciting, and useful as a dialogic technique, as you  will find when reading both Cry The Beloved Mind or Quakes (both also available  on <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com">www.brainvoyage.com</a> in electronic format).<br>

      I apologize for a misunderstanding  here due entirely to my inappropriate labeling of the programs I was refering  to. There were no fictitious components. With the heatwave programme, the  problem was that our media simply had not cottoned on to the medical  implications of the unpresidented heat wave, nor realised the number of  fatalities or near fatalities it caused in this country, though there had been  some coverage of the problems in France which were even worse. There was only  footage of people enjoying the weather. They used the real events. The actual  people involved were used where ever possible and re-created scenes. For some  events it was not possible to get the original partisipants and actors were  used to recreate the scenes which were clearly marked as re-creations with  actors. The doctors and hospitals featured were ones that had actually been  involved. They explained how even people who were acting sensibly in the  weather conditions could become so ill. The only departure from reportage of  actual events were interviews with medical and paramedical staff explaining how  the system would have broken down had the heatwave continued and how near they  came to that break down. This I think is akin to your stories, true events with  explanations as to how the illness is caused and how treated.</p>

<p>Classifying such portrayals, they are not futuristic, nor imaginary or  speculative, hence they are not science fiction.<br>
      They are not fiction, with characters and  events based in fact, but the tale being fiction, hence they are not faction.<br>
      Superficially such portrayals fit the description of sciction in that  they are non-fiction, based on fact, with characters renamed. But this is  necessary but not sufficient.</p>
<p>However, to classify these descriptions as sciction would require  additional criteria. If this kind of description sounds like &quot;only names  and faces have been changed to protect innocent people&quot;, that would not  involve the composite tales that reflect the hallmark of sciction. This genre  is directed towards educating in scientific information and principles, by  using not only disguised individuals but composite case histories or  portrayals: each portion happened but not necessarily together on the same  person or patient or event. The person, patient or event is irrelevant to the  education. They are just the literary vehicles. This is why sciction has a  literary component and this is where the component of fiction comes in-sciction  deals with portrayals directed towards education through fascination by using a  literary technique.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the paragraph beginning &quot;Classifying&quot; involves a series of  subparagraphs, allowing easier reading, yet maintaining the theme. If a  subparagraph involves dialogue, it becomes a conversagraph.</p>
