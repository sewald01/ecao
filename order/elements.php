<br><br>

Many people like the convenience of instant ordering on the
world wide web. You can fill out our order form with your billing
information and your bank card number. Then press the button (&quot;order&quot;
) . Your order is encrypted on the secured server. We receive
it and it becomes a priority for sending out the book. Your credit
card will be billed for this under Brainquest Press. (If you are
ordering the Electronic Version of the Book, you will be ordering
through Digital River and your credit card will mention their
name.)&nbsp; Internet sales are a relatively new technology greatly
facilitating shopping. You may have questions about the safety
and security of ordering.

<br><br>

The Internet has available secured servers. Careful study has
allowed the necessary measures to assure that your bank card data
cannot be easily intercepted during your transaction.&nbsp; However,
the risks of any credit card apply. The risks are those that exist
in regular shopping or mail order where a credit card number is
misused by people. We, of course, take care that only those we
know have access to such cards.&nbsp; Some Web browsers (including
Netscape Navigator or Communicator) may indicate that messages
between your Web browser and our server could be intercepted by
a third party. Such security breaches would compromise any internet
shopping on secured servers and technology is such that the risk
in ordering on the internet because of information being intercepted
is possibly no more than in any regular store.
<br><br>
You will be giving us your information on a secured server
from bookzone.com. You will recognize it as secured because it
has the address https: // and this allows your credit card to
be given out there. However, you can also order by Phone, Fax,
or Postal Service: so if you prefer, you may DOWNLOAD this form
for printing and fax it to us (206) 526-1522.
<br><br>
In fact, we are in the process of converting all our book and
EZine orders to this site on brainvoyage.com.<BR>
We will not only have a secured server, but we will even have
a certificate from one of the two largest security providers on
the Internet.<BR>
This is purely for your peace of mind.
<br><br>
<P>If you fax, you do not need a cover sheet: preferably send
only the one page of your printout: as a PDF this will be easy;
but depending on your settings and printer the text copy will
likely spread over to two pages.</P>

<P>If you cannot read this form, please E-Mail a request for an
order form to: difficulty@brainvoyage.com -- you need not include
anything in your e-mail except in the subject line write the words
SEND ORDER FORM. An automatic e-mail will send you this page for
completion.)</P>
