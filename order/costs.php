Each of these printed books is autographed, and some are customized personalized. 
The custom in the book industry is no returns on signed books and we cannot offer 
refunds on purchases. <br>

      <hr width="100%" noshade>
      This is the base edition, with the author's signature on the title page. 
      It is still a great bargain: not only is there $1 off but you receive a 
      potentially valuable collector's item because it is signed.<br> <br> </td>

      The author will write an address of up to two people, along with a choice 
      by the buyer of one of three short phrases like &quot;Good luck&quot; , 
      and his signature, on the title or dedication page. The potential collector's 
      value may go up because of the special message and names in the book.<br>

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top"> <div class="emphasis"><strong>Personalized</strong> - $26.95</div>
      <hr width="100%" noshade>
The author will write an address of up to three people, along with a custom phrase of no more than 10 words (additional words available for a fee), along with his signature and the date. 
Because of its marked personal nature, it may be the most valuable of the three choices not only from a collector's perspective, but because it will have special sentimental and personal value to the reader.

Limited copies are still available. Numbered Copies between 20 and 99 are $30 extra, for the lucky ten people who acquire numbers 10-19, this is $60 extra per book, 
numbers 6-9 are $120 extra, and numbers 2-4 are $250 extra per book. 
Most of the numbers are still available. This comes specially wrapped to maintain its proof condition.
