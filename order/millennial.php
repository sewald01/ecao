    <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+3">Special Millennial Edition</FONT> 
  </CENTER>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">You cannot obtain an autographed copy from any other 
  source unless you are lucky enough to meet with Dr Neppe. Although this cannot 
  be guaranteed, it is usual that autographed versions can become significantly 
  more valuable as collector's items. Numerous determining factors are involved 
  but this being a first edition could make it more so. Even more so, you may 
  even be able to obtain a personalized, customized or millennial edition copy. 
  See below for more details. As is the custom in the book industry, there are 
  no returns once the author has signed a copy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Clearly the Millennial Edition version is for a unique 
  occasion.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">Millennial Collection Editions</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">First only for collectors, the <B>MILLENNIUM COLLECTION 
  EDITION</B>. This does not address anyone specifically, unless you request it 
  (same price) (e.g. &quot;To Tom Smith&quot; ) but instead contains the words 
  &quot;Special Millennium Edition&quot; and dated 1/1/2000. and signed by Vernon 
  Neppe, the author. Consequently, it can only be mailed out from that date.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">COSTS: $25 extra for those numbered between 20 and 99.<BR>
  For the lucky ten people who want numbers 10-19, this is $50 extra per book, 
  and 1-9 is $100 extra per book. If these numbers are unavailable, the next level 
  up will be used and charged for.<BR>
  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE COPIES MAY STILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER 1/1/2000 
  SO DO ENQUIRE.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">WHY ORDER A MILLENIAL EDITION?<BR>
  Whereas no warranties or guarantees can be given, there is good reason why this 
  millennial version could inflate in value.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1. This is the first book written in the new literary 
    genre of sciction.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">2. A numbered autographed first edition makes this 
    a collector's item.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. This book has been very well received and may become 
    a classic.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The MILLENIAL EDITION is a speculative, but may be an 
  excellent long-term investment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Collectors will want this book. We advise you to not 
  use the book much and cover it in transparent plastic or similar material so 
  it can maintain its original appearance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">PERSONALIZED AND CUSTOMIZED VERSIONS<BR>
  </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">THERE ARE FOUR LEVELS OF AUTOGRAPH FROM THE AUTHOR.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1. The first -- above-- is the <B>MILLENIAL EDITION.</B><BR>
  2. Second are straight <B>AUTOGRAPHED</B> copies: The author's signature alone 
  appears on the title page and this is not an extra price <BR>
  3. Third, the title page can be <B>CUSTOMIZED</B>. e.g. &quot;To Jack and Jill, 
  With best wishes. (signature)&quot; Choice of phrases: &quot;With best wishes.&quot; 
  &quot;Enjoy!&quot; &quot;Good luck.&quot; This is $2.50 extra. <BR>
  4. Fourth, the Rolls Royce, is <B>PERSONALIZED</B>. Personalized inscription 
  is involved if there are more than two names or more than three words in the 
  inscription. It is $5 extra provided not more than a total of ten words (excluding 
  the To Jack and Jill line, signature and date) and $0.50 per word extra beyond 
  twelve. You can suggest exact wording but <I>no guarantees can be made and Dr 
  Neppe's decision is final</I> in that regard. An example would be &nbsp;&quot;To 
  Jack , Jill and Peter. With my very best wishes. Good luck to you all. Vernon 
  M Neppe. 2/1/2000.&quot; <BR>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">PLEASE MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. FILL IN UNDER 
  COMMENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORDER FORM.</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#000000"><BR>
  Brainvoyage.com has developed an order form which will include all these variations. 
  YOU MUST MENTION THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE YOU WANT DR NEPPE TO ADDRESS IF YOU 
  ORDER PERSONALIZED, CUSTOMIZED OR MILLENIAL COPIES. E.G. To Jack and Jill. IF 
  YOU DON'T, WE CANNOT ADDRESS ANYONE.<BR>
  <BR>
  When you complete the order form, you may check &quot;Personalized&quot; (which 
  will mean Dr Neppe will personalize for $2.50 more; if you prefer wording indicate 
  e.g. &quot;To Jack and Jill. With best wishes.&quot; If no wording: Dr Neppe 
  chooses.<BR>
  If you check &quot;Customized&quot; (with your words of customization) e.g. 
  &quot;To Linda, Jeff and Veronica, This book is important to me.&quot; If no 
  wording, Dr Neppe will choose.<BR>
  If you check, &quot;Millennial&quot; (Here the words are not customized as there 
  is a fixed script) but you can choose whether you want &quot;To Linda, Jeff 
  and Veronica&quot; or no address (default). <BR>
  You can stipulate &quot;Millennial Lowest&quot; which would mean that if numbers 
  1-10 were available, you could receive these.</FONT></P>
