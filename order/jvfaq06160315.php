There are three main files to download: <br>
They are all in the very standard PDF format which requires Adobe Acrobat Reader, a free program. They are not compressed.
You can these files download them in any order. 
<br><br>
1. An Agreement file which includes a disclaimer including mentioning always seeking appropriate medical advice.
This is only about 16K in size and should take seconds to download on a fast connection, and only minutes or less on a modem.  
<br>2. A convenient Glossary file of about 33 pages derived from the book Cry the Beloved
Mind: A Voyage of Hope (about 600K). This should take take seconds to download on a fast connection, and only minutes or less on a modem.
<br>3. The full text of the book Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope. This text is slightly updated from the printed copy of the book to ensure easy readability.  This  electronic book  is 1917K or about 2 megabytes. Download on cable lines takes about 8 seconds. This file has the Glossary included, as well.</td>

    <td valign=top class="bighead">A</td>
    <td class=data> Successfully downloading the book can be challenging, especially 
      on a slower connection. The larger the file, the more time it takes to download, 
      and presents more opportunity for interruption. This is why we recommend 
      only those with Cable, DSL, T1 or other fast connections try this route 
      and do not take responsibility for slower connections, though it may work. 
      However, if you have a dial up connection, the following may be useful<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes on your browser, like Netscape, AOL or Internet Explorer, or in 
      your PPP/ IP application that is used to connect you onto the net, there 
      is an option like &quot;disconnect after inactivity of thirty minutes.&quot; 
      If your browser does not recognize the downloading as activity, you may 
      be disconnected. This can be changed usually by changing the period to longer, 
      say 120 minutes before disconnecting. Usually you have to quit your browser 
      or PPP program for this to take effect. If this is so, try to download again.<br>
      If you have purchased the software and want to try to download again, you 
      can use the same password you were given. If you still cannot download: 
      Unfornately, we cannot offer free tech support but you can phone us at 206 
      527 8229. Please ensure that you have your particulars and your order number 
      you were given. </td>
