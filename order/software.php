  <p> "Do you have a Macintosh? If yes, are you interested in obtaining software 
    that at a basic level may read individual pages of this book? If so, you can 
    download Spell Tools from Newer Technologies. Understand that at present the 
    spell tools may not work. For those of you are technically minded, the spell 
    tools will attach to the PDF file of the Acrobat Reader and you may click 
    individual pages of text file and it will read (we like Agnes's voice). However, 
    you may want to wait for the upgrades as we are finding this is at present 
    not working well.
