  <blockquote>
    If you have already ordered the full-priced electronic version of the book, you were given a serial number by Digital River in your 
    confirmation email. Please keep this email, because we are unable to look up lost or misplaced serial numbers. Because you have 
    ordered the full-priced electronic version, you are entitled to a one-time $5 reduction on one copy of the book. 
    <br><br>
    In order to get the $5 discount, simply put your Digital River serial number in the appropriate spot on the order form to receive the
    discount. If you fail to do this, neither Brainvoyage.com nor Digital River can give you your 5 dollar discount. However, the serial
    number will still be good if you wish to make a future purchase at the discounted price. The serial number from a discounted digital
    purchase will be declined and you will be charged the full price.
    <br><br>
    Also, unfortunately, we cannot go back once the order is processed and credit you the $5 later so that it is your responsibility to do
    fill in the correct serial number. The serial number must be filled in at the same time as your book is ordered so that we can process 
    both together. If you have any questions please contact us.
