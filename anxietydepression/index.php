<h3>Welcome to our special "depression and anxiety" page. Let's learn, too, about the complex areas 
of mental illness and bipolar disorders.</h3>

<p>But first we want to tell you about one of the most valued books ever on this topic. <a href="http://www.pni.org/clinical/briefneppebio.htm">Dr. Vernon Neppe</a> has written a book devoting aspects several chapters to this area in his highly esteemed and very important book on brain
medications and ethical dilemmas, <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm">Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope</a>.  What readers have regarded as a "must get".<br>

<p>"Dr. Vernon Neppe has written one of the most important works dealing with 
  brain medications and social dilemmas ever penned. This book has helped me understand 
  that I am not alone, and that there is hope for a complete recovery. Dr. Neppe 
  has the rare ability to view his patients with both clinical detachment as well 
  as human beings, with fears, anguish, worry, terror and everything in between. 
  This wonderful volume should be required reading for anyone with curiosity or 
  concerns. "Cry The Beloved Mind" will change more than minds; it will change 
  LIVES!" <em>Karen (<a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/comments.php">Read More</a>)</em></p>

<p>Of course, we've already learnt about many other areas like <em>Drug interactions.</em> 
As Marilyn, non-patient reader, eloquently puts it: "<em>Unbelievable, but this book makes us actually want to read about absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination of medications!</em>" You may want to understand about some of the basic aspects. We understand about the interactions of cigarette smoke, the problems with jet lag, and even the role of Vitamin B6. We are taken through analogies like boats and bathtubs and of course, coffee and caffeine in anxiety.</p> 

<p>But how does the book read? Easily? <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/">Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope</a> by the international expert <a href="http://www.pni.org/clinical/briefneppebio.htm">Vernon Neppe MD, PhD</a> is written so the layperson can understand about how they and their loved ones can get better on appropriate medications. Try it. Here is the beginning of a chapter on depression to boot "<em><a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/excerpts_ch11.php">Three Steps Forward, One Step Back</a></em>." You can see this book is written in the special new literary genre of <a href="http://brainvoyage.com/sciction/index.php">sciction - science through literature</a>. It "<em>educates by fascination</em>." And this just may be a reason why the author autographed book may become a <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/autographed.php">collector's item</a>.</p>

<p>As a reader says about these sections after reading the book:</p>
<p>"WONDERFUL BOOK, EASY READ. No longer do you have to feel different or 
  alone in a world without hope or answers. This book gives the reader a great 
  deal of insight on mental health conditions and the different kinds of medications 
  used to treat them. I think anyone suffering from a mental condition, such as 
  depression will benefit from this book. As you read through the many different 
  chapters I am sure you will find somewhere or someone you will identify with 
  or see yourself in. It made me feel I wasn't the only one in the world on medications 
  for depression or a seizure related condition. I felt compelled to keep reading 
  and reading until I finished the book. I came away with a better understanding 
  of my own treatment and the way medications work in the treatment of these illnesses. 
  I would recommend this book to anyone who is suffering from a mental condition 
  or family and friends of anyone suffering from a mental condition. Dr. Neppe 
  has been able to bring this book down to a level that is easy to understand 
  and read, and at the same time is encouraging and yes, very 'HOPEFUL'." <em>Cindy, BarnesandNoble.com review</em></p> 
<p><a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/comments.php">Read the others thoughts, too</a>, because this opinion is the common one. <em>We have yet to have someone not finding this book valuable!</em></p>

 <p>"<strong>This should be essential reading for psychology students</strong>. It would certainly have made my life much easier, if I had available such a readable way to be educated. The unique case histories and focus on social and medical issues make the book very important." <em>Glenn Goodwin, PhD, Neuropsychologist</em></p> 
  
<p>"<strong>This book takes us to the core of what Medicine is about: to listen to what the patient is saying, not only with their word, but with their acts and the cry of help that their mind is doing. Great job Dr. Neppe.</strong>" <em>Jose L. Guzman</em></p>   
 
<p>"<strong>Dr. Neppe demonstrates his international expertise with care and respect for patients</strong>. He conveys hope and valuable information for more than just the general reader. I learned a great deal." <em> Dale Sobotka, MD, Psychiatrist.</em></p>
