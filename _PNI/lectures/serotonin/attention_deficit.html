<H2>Educational Objectives</H2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    To educate in the areas of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
    and irritability in children and adolescents.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To present early information on the use of the azapirone 
    compounds alone or as adjunct in ADHD and
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To link aggression and ADHD with the serotonin 1A receptor and 
    show the limitations of this approach.
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients often 
present with school or behavioral problems linked with difficulty 
concentrating / distractibility and an impulsivity manifesting 
often as irritability and low frustration tolerance (3%-5% of 
children with 75%-90% males). Hyperactivity is marked in three 
quarters of these patients. Subtle organic cerebral deficits are 
common (a quarter). Biochemically psychostimulants commonly 
diminish hyperactivity. Disputably up to half such patients have 
emotional problems at home sometimes secondary to the ADHD, 
leading to a heterogeneity of diagnosis for the condition. A 
common scale for measurement is the Connors Teacher and Parent 
Scale particularly an abbreviated version, where the cutoff score 
of 15 on 10 special items (each ordinally ranked 0 to 3) for ADHD 
is traditional.
</P>

<P>
Psychostimulants such as methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) (Schedule 2) or 
pemoline (Cylert) (Sched 4) are the most common treatments for 
ADHD but are not benign agents. Their mechanism is poorly understood, 
linked with dopamine and "paradoxical" effects on the reticular 
activating system. Dependence problems may occur particularly in 
other family members. Poorly controlled patients have received 
adjunctive or alternative therapies to the psychostimulants such 
as tricyclic antidepressant (e.g. imipramine, phenothiazines e.g. 
thioridazine and clonidine) with limited success or potential 
accentuation of side-effects.
</P>

<P>
A significant ADHD symptom that is commonly poorly controlled with 
psychostimulants is irritability. This suggests that at least in 
this subpopulation a partially different biochemical mechanism is 
involved. Exploration of aggression spectrum concepts such as 
anger, aggression, hostility, irritability and impulsivity are 
compromised by the general equivalent use of these terms, measuring 
difficulties, lack of research in the area and particularly no 
current diagnostic framework for aggression in DSM 3R or DSM-IV, 
with consequently no FDA approved drugs for aggression. All 
treatments being therefore innovative psychopharmacotherapy.
</P>

<P>
Evidence exists for serotonin receptor involvement in the 
aggression spectrum using animal models and human studies 
(clinical and post-mortem). The serotonin 1A receptor is 
promising using non-specific models such as lithium carbonate, 
beta-adrenergic blocking agents and benzodioxines. The only 
selective group for serotonin 1A in therapeutic doses is the 
azapirones. Animal models suggest the azapirones are potent 
anti-aggressive agents. This should be via their specific 
serotonin 1A  partial agonist effects at postsynaptic doses 
or specific full agonist effects at the autoreceptor level 
in lower doses. The only currently marketed azapirone is 
buspirone. Irritability is an early target symptom of response 
with buspirone in generalized anxiety disorder possibly 
implying persistent low-dose effects. Moreover, buspirone 
improves concentration.
</P>

<P>
<I>Preliminary</I> open experience by Neppe suggests a biphasic 
dose effect for buspirone: Low dose buspirone (5-25 mg per day) 
was effective after a few days in alleviating irritability, 
anger and hostility without associated significant anxiety 
(N&gt;50); higher doses such as 60-90 mg per day almost 
immediately greatly relieved manic irritability, agitation, 
restlessness and mood lability (N=12). This data requires 
adequate controlled studies. Ratey's work is similar but 
in mental retardates. McCormick, 1994 found 9/10 children 
improved in a short (2 weeks buspirone), randomized 
double-blind crossover ADHD study of buspirone alone in very 
low doses (5mg q8am and q11am on weekdays) versus placebo, 
using the 10 point abbreviated Connors rating scale.
</P>

<P>
In our large open pilot study in Reno, Nevada led by Dr Zo 
Young, buspirone was hypothesized to improve ADHD target symptoms 
such as irritability and concentration (N=40). Children and 
adolescents (aged 5-15 years at entry and mainly males) in DSM3R 
ADHD patients with Connors scores of &gt;15 who had only partly 
responded to psychostimulant received <I>buspirone</I> (usually 
10mg tid; range 10-45mg /day) as <I>adjunct</I> to conventional 
doses of <I>methyl-phenidate</I> (usually 10-20mg tid) or rarely 
<I>pemoline</I> (37.5 mg bid or tid). 
</P>

<P>
Buspirone clinically improved several target symptoms: 
<I>concentration / distractibility / school functioning</I>;
<I>irritability / anger / temper tantrums / low frustration tolerance</I>.
Additionally these children, improved in <I>sleep disturbance</I> 
and where present anxiety or anxiety-depression.
</P>

<P>
A <I>further population of aggressive non-ADHD</I> children also 
responded well to <I>buspirone alone</I> in similar doses (ultimately 
20/27). Because of the open, clinical nature of the study, 
statistics have limited meaning but relevant clinical improvements 
ostensibly occurred in &gt; 90% of ADHDs and 74 % of non-ADHD patients. 
Efficacy occurred within a week but took &gt;four weeks for full 
effects. Follow-up periods have been up to 5 years with no loss of 
efficacy. The buspirone was well tolerated. Overall, side-effects 
were reported only rarely (&lt;6%  usually dizziness.  Further 
clinical study, suggests <I>buspirone alone</I> does not apparently 
improve hyperactivity (N=5) again suggesting a special functional 
limitation for serotonin 1A probes.
