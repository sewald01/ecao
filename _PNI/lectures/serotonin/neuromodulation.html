<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The serotonin receptors modulate a variety of basic functions at 
a large number of levels. These functions reflect serotonin 1A 
neuromodulators as well. The clinical application is broad because 
drug action at the serotonin 1A receptor subtype involves low 
toxicity, lack of dependency and no sedation. Moreover, some 
serotonin 1A related compounds act selectively at that receptor. 
This combined with  the uniqueness of the 1A subtype in acting 
at the autoreceptor in the raphe nucleus and post-synaptically 
in areas of the brain of strategic relevance to psychopathology 
makes their potential application in psychiatry and medicine 
substantial. Finally, the availability of post-synaptic partial 
agonists at the receptor level makes the application potentially 
enormous.
</P>

<P>
Serotonin 1A receptor action can be measured relatively specifically 
by the azapirones. These act as partial agonists postsynaptically 
and full agonists at the autoreceptor. Non-specifically, 
beta 2 -adrenergic receptor blockers (like propranolol) produce 
overall serotonin 1A receptor antagonist effects. The 
benzodioxines, an experimental group, which includes 
eltoprazine, act as partial agonists postsynaptically on both 
5HT 1A and 1B receptors. Lithium has very non-specific effects 
but technically is a serotonin 1A agonist. It is marketed for 
manic-depressive illness prophylaxis and treatment of mania 
(e.g. 450-1500 mg per day with serum levels such as 0.4 to 0.7 
to 1.0 meq / L). Similar doses have been used in open cases 
for aggression (not approved).
</P>

<P>
The literature on beta-blockers and the role of serotonin 1A 
in this regard is reviewed. The perspectives in somatic 
anxiety, akathisia and aggression particularly may be relevant. 
Low doses of beta-blocker (e.g. 10 mg tid of nadolol or propranolol) 
may act peripherally on the beta-adrenergic receptor.  
Anti-akathisic effects require lipid solubility and beta-2 drugs 
implying 5HT 1A effects (e.g. 20mg tid of propranolol). Higher 
doses of lipid soluble beta-2-blocker such as propranolol in 
enormous doses (e.g. 240mg q.i.d. of propranolol monitored 
carefully because of safety considerations) have been occasionally 
used in aggression and probably are serotonin related.
</P>

<P>
Specific serotonin modulators are evaluated using the 
azapirones as the pharmacologic probe. Buspirone as the 
only marketed azapirone is approved for use only in anxiety 
and mixed anxiety depressive states, however, clinical 
experience in several other areas is interesting but 
still at various early research stages.
</P>

<P>
Low doses of buspirone (5-20mg ) probably act at the autoreceptor 
as agonists effectively producing post-synaptic antagonism across 
all serotonin receptor subtypes. These doses are provisionally 
excellent anti-aggressive agents using animal and human 
models. They may have adjunctive use in attention deficit disorder.
Speculatively, they help SSRI induced akathisia: This effect may 
be post-synaptic partial agonism with the antagonist effect 
being uppermost (dosing 15-30mg per day). Medium doses act 
post-synaptically modulating the prophylaxis of anxiety (30-45mg /day).
Higher doses are weak agonists and may correspond with weak 
antidepressant effects (45-60 mg / day). Serotonin 1A partial 
agonism may imply adjunctive use of buspirone or other 
azapirones in instances when SSRI compounds stop facilitating 
depression. Higher doses may also imply some modulation of 
obsessionality (60mg / day), disputably post-traumatic stress 
disorder (60-75 mg / day) and even possible effects on the 
irritability of the manic (60-90 mg / day). Such doses also may 
induce mild akathisia:  this may imply a serotonin 1A 
modulating role, but this is complex as serotonin re-uptake 
blockers like fluoxetine which act broadly also induce 
akathisia; moreover this can be blocked by buspirone.
Finally extremely high doses of buspirone appear very promising 
anti-tardive dyskinesia agents (120-240 mg per day): as these effects 
may be tentatively blocked by cyproheptadine, this too may be 
via serotonin 1A neuromodulation of the known partial dopamine 
agonist effects of buspirone in conventionally supratherapeutic 
doses. The scanty literature is discussed.
