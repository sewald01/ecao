<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
Three clinical scenarios relate to patients who fail treatment after 
receiving selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drugs.  Acutely, 
they may experience the "I'm  climbing out of my skin" feeling; more 
chronically over several weeks the "It's not working anymore" complaint; 
and over many months an "It worked so well before" amazement. This paper 
examines theoretical and practical options using combination serotonin 
antidepressant therapy.
</P>

<P>A broader theory of management of such patients can be developed 
with the understanding of concepts such as neuromodulation, partial 
agonism and the serotonin bathtub analogy. Moreover, serotonin 
modulates many basic functions at a large number of levels 
allowing explanations of such conundrums as the delayed effects 
of antidepressants. Finally receptor specificity is critical to 
appreciating why drugs work and fail. Drug action at the serotonin 
1A receptor subtype is particularly important. It involves 
post-synaptic effects in areas of the brain of strategic relevance 
to psychopathology. Drugs such as the azapirones generally have 
apparent low toxicity, lack of dependency and sedation and 
selectivity at the Serotonin 1 A receptor with partial agonism 
making their potential application in psychiatry substantial.

<P>
Buspirone is the only marketed azapirone (approved for use only 
in anxiety and mixed anxiety depressive states). However, 
clinical experience in several other areas is interesting but still 
at various early research stages. Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors 
like fluoxetine induce a serotonergic akathisia which can be blocked 
by buspirone. When SSRI compounds stop working with 
re-exacerbation of depression, adjunctive use of azapirones 
may theoretically extend their action. High therapeutic azapirone 
doses may also imply some modulation of obsessionality and weak 
antidepressant effects.
