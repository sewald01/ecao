<H2>BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE BEHAVIORAL NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION</H2>

<P>
The <I>neuropsychiatric mental status or behavioral neurological 
examination</I> interfaces between psychiatry and neurology. Its 
object is to evaluate global and focal functions of the cerebral 
cortex. Never to be neglected on the one side is evaluation of 
the patient's mental status at a psychiatric level - such features 
as appearance, consciousness, orientation, intelligence, cognitive 
functions, affect, motoric behavior, motivation, behavior in the 
ward, interpersonal relations, insight, judgment and dangerousness.
</P>

<P>
On the other hand, particular areas of interface in the 
neurological examination are: level of consciousness, attention 
span, memory, presence or absence of primitive reflexes such as 
grasp, pout, snout, palmar mental reflexes, Babinski signs, and 
basic evaluations of the patient's power and tone.  Evaluations 
of the person's emotions and reaction to stress are also 
fundamental.
</P>

<P>
The examples below are of items useful to use in your practice. 
Behavioral neurological examination consists specifically of 
the following headings:
</P>

<P>Evaluations of :</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Consciousness</LI>
  <LI>Orientation for time, place, and space</LI>
  <LI>Evaluation of speech, i.e. dysphasia, dysarthria, dysphonia</LI>
  <LI>Evaluation of praxis</LI>

  <LI>
    Evaluation of gnosis, i.e. recognition, interpretation 
    and organization of percepts - agnosias
  </LI>

  <LI>Evaluations of memory</LI>
  <LI>Intelligence - verbal</LI>
  <LI>Calculation</LI>
  <LI>Melodic functions</LI>
  <LI>Frontal-temporal functioning</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Assessment of the <I>neuropsychiatric mental status</I> of the patient 
is vital in any patient who may exhibit features of possible 
coarse neurobehavioral disease. One rapid but very inadequate 
method has involved the 30 point <I>Folstein Mini-Mental Status 
Examination</I> which is loaded with regard to orientation and 
memory items (15 out of 30), and which requires very substantial 
impairment, generally easily clinically diagnosed before the 
patient scores the 21-23 out of 30 or less generally perceived 
as clinically relevant. In addition, patients with depression 
may commonly not score near the 29 or 30 out of 30 expected in 
the non-demented.  Consequently it is neither sensitive nor 
specific.
</P>

<P>
A very promising instrument has been developed at the University of 
Washington, the <I>BROCAS SCAN</I> <I>(Screening Cerebral Assessment 
of Neppe)</I>. This takes 15-30 minutes and involves 40 items. 
The B of the term BROCAS refers to <I>behavior</I>, and all facets 
of the Mental Status Examination are compared with the behavioral 
component. The ROCAS items are made up of two each of R-O-C-A-S: 
recall, recognition, orientation, organization, concentration, 
calculation, apraxia, agnosia, speech and sensory motor reflex. 
The typical items which are useful for students to apply are 
included below. The following brief behavioral examination 
exemplified by the Clinical BROCAS SCAN items can be performed:
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Evaluation of the person's <U>gait</U></LI>

  <LI>
    Evaluation of his level of <U>consciousness</U>: 
    this may require tests pertaining to variability of 
    response, e.g. favorite color, favorite relation, 
    favorite food.
  </LI>

  <LI>Evaluation of <U>orientation</U></LI>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>Orientation for time: date, day of week, time of day, season</LI>
    <LI>For space (geographic orientation in ward)</LI>
    <LI>For place (name of ward, of hospital)</LI>
  </OL>

  <P>Orientation is a global cerebral function.</P>

  <LI>Evaluation of <U>speech</U> for aphasia</LI>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>
      Examine fluency of speech, spontaneity of speech 
      and word finding ability.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Specific tasks like repeating "no ifs, ands, or buts 
      about it," "Constitution of the State of Massachusetts," 
      and "I am."
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Identify and name certain objects in the room, certain
      body parts, certain colors.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Respond to a question requiring comprehension, i.e. 
      "source of illumination," "through where does the wind 
      blow into this room?"
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Disturbances of speech may reflect pathology all the way 
      through from Wernicke's area in the superior posterior temporal 
      cortex through to Broca's area in the posterior-lateral frontal 
      cortex.  Fibers along the way may be impaired.  Anomia or 
      inability to name objects is a more non-specific function 
      located generally in the posterior temporal-parietal areas. 
      When there are visual inputs, then there may be occipital 
      components to this. Specific localizations have been 
      hypothesized for localization objects, body parts, and colors. 
      Fluent aphasias generally reflect Wernicke's area pathology, 
      non-fluent aphasias reflect expressive difficulties in the 
      frontal lobe Broca's area.
    </LI>
  </OL>

  <LI>Evaluations of <U>apraxia</U></LI>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>
      Ask the patient to copy a diagram; the diagrams may involve a 
      Greek cross, and more complex figures, such as a triangle with a 
      circle with certain distortions.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Ask the person to construct a clock, e.g. with the time 10 past 11. 
      This involves both sides of the visual field, and the 10 has to be 
      conceived as a 2 on the clock. Tests of copying and construction 
      while often cited as tests of praxis involve visuospatial perception 
      and visuomotor integration - gnosis.  Substantial skill is required 
      to differentiate the site of the lesion.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Ask the person to perform the following task: with the middle 
      finger of the right hand to touch his nose, and pull his left 
      ear.
    </LI>

    <P>
      Tests such as middle finger of right hand involve testing of finger 
      parts and testing of right and left orientation.  When the right 
      hand moves to touch the left ear, this shifts across the body 
      mid-line involving cross-lateralization.  This apparently
      simple task also involves touching the nose and then the ear and 
      this requires sequential organization. These tasks therefore 
      require additive evaluation in order to adequately interpret 
      them. These functions therefore involve the perceptual, 
      integrative, and executive functions.  At the perceptual level, 
      the patient would be agnosic, and this would predominantly 
      reflect posterior parietal pathology. At the integrative-executive 
      level, the patient would be apraxic, and this may reflect frontal 
      lobe pathology. Fibers running between these areas and also 
      leading inferiorly through to, for example, the cerebellum, and 
      involving the motor system make these evaluations more difficult.
    </P>
  </OL>

  <LI><U>Memory function</U></LI>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>
      <U>Verbal memory function</U> may be evaluated giving the 
      patient four facts about the interviewer, e.g. name, origin, 
      kind and color of car. Abstract words such as "peace, analyze, 
      concept" can also be used.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      <U>Visual memory function</U> can be assessed by retesting 
      the copied drawing he did.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      <U>Verbal-visual function</U> involves guessing five objects 
      in the room, e.g. floor, table, window, shoe, pencil.
    </LI>
  </OL>

  <P>Memory function is complex.</P>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>
      To test <U>registration</U>, the patient should 
      be re-evaluated immediately.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      If he is able to register this information, can he 
      <U>retain</U> it?
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Is he able to to appropriately <U>recognize</U> it?
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Can he <U>recall</U> it spontaneously? Can he 
      <U>recall</U> it with cues?
    </LI>
  </OL>

  <P>
    These functions can be tested individually, and should be. 
    Test global memory functions by interrupting the task and 
    retesting a few minutes later. Visual memory impairment may 
    reflect non-dominant hemispheric involvement, verbal memory 
    dominant hemispheric involvement. Generally these memory 
    functions all reflect particularly hippocampal functioning.
  </P>

  <LI><U>Intelligence</U></LI>

  <P>
    Verbal intelligence can be evaluated by usage of words, 
    by vocabulary, comprehension, digits span forwards and 
    backwards, general knowledge and information, proverb 
    interpretation, ability to perceive similarities and 
    differences.
  </P>

  <LI><U>Calculation</U></LI>

  <P>
    Tests of calculation reflect specifically defects which 
    are disproportionate to the person's general verbal 
    intelligence. Ask the patient simple addition and subtraction 
    (under 100).  Test the limits of his ability.
  </P>

  <P>
    If calculation is disproportionately disturbed, this may 
    reflect parietal lobe functioning, specifically left parietal 
    functioning. At times, however, dyscalculia due to incapacity 
    for spatial organization and numerical operations is more 
    common with right sided lesions.
  </P>

  <LI>
    <U>Melodies</U> or testing for aprosodia is useful in 
    that this may reflect non-dominant frontal temporal lobe 
    pathology, in parallel with speech organization. Screen this 
    by the patient's ability to:
  </LI>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>spontaneously hear, and</LI>
    <LI>repeat tunes</LI>
  </OL>

  <P>These tests are, however, poor screens.</P>

  <LI>
    Tests for <U>frontal lobe functioning</U> relates 
    specifically to:
  </LI>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>Tapping abilities and</LI>

    <LI>
      Abilities to <U>perform</U> repetitive complex movements 
      such as "fist, flat of hand, side of hand," and the ability 
      to change cognitive set.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      At a <U>verbal</U> level this may involve counting in 
      three's, and subtracting back in two's, and spelling 
      words such as &quot;<U>world</U>&quot; forward and 
      backward.
    </LI>
  </OL>

  <LI>
    Tests for temporal lobe functioning involve screening 
    for visual fields.
  </LI>

  <P>
    Other frontal-temporal signs are noted behaviorally, and 
    many temporal lobe features are obtained on history, or 
    using structured instruments such as the Inventory of Neppe 
    of Symptoms of Epilepsy and the Temporal Lobe (INSET).

<H2>THE GERIATRIC CONTEXT: ORGANIC AND NEUROBEHAVIORAL</H2>


<P>
<I>Organic mental disorders</I> are a class of disorders of mental 
functioning and behavior caused by transient or permanent dysfunction 
of the brain. As these disorders are a heterogeneous group, no single 
description can characterize them.  The differences in clinical 
presentation reflect differences in localization, mode of onset, 
progression, duration and nature of underlying pathophysiological 
processes. There are a great many potential causes of cerebral 
dysfunction. The underlying cerebral disease or disorder may be 
primary, such as a brain tumor, or secondary to a systemic 
dysfunction. Organic mental disorders may occur at any age, but many 
are more prevalent in the population over 60 years of age.
</P>

<P>
As psychiatry becomes more biological, it is assumed that all 
AXIS I disorders have some organic basis. When we used the term 
Organic Mental Disorder in DSM - III R, we are talking about 
relative degrees of organicity. The organicity in these disorders 
involves a clear-cut organic element, sometimes called 
<I>coarse neurobehavioral</I> syndrome. Clearly these occur at 
all ages. However, the elderly is a particularly important group. 
DSM -1V dropped the term organic for such descriptions as 
&quot;symptomatic&quot; or &quot;due to medical conditions.&quot;
</P>

<P>
<I>Neurobehavioral</I> is a term which is commonly used, 
particularly in behavioral neurology, and in neuropsychiatry. This 
term is particularly relevant in describing not only the 
<I>coarse chronic</I> disorders above, but demarcating a 
specific lack in DSM IIIR namely <I>episodic or paroxysmal</I> 
neurobehavioral disorders relating to episodic conditions 
deriving from a specified condition in the brain such as temporal 
lobe disorder linked with "spells" of marked lability of affect 
over hours or episodic rage. "Neurobehavioral" in this context 
may be perceived as a substitute for "organic", but will not be part 
of the official terminology. Other possible synonyms that still 
appear in books and should be recognized are "organic cerebral 
syndromes", "organic brain syndromes" and "organic psychosis."
</P>

<P>
The term <I>organic</I> is used in older psychiatric nomenclature, namely
DSM-I11R. However, the term <I>organic</I> is not used
currently  in DSM-IV. This is so because most psychiatric illness is
based on organic abnormalities - biochemical, anatomic
or physiologic: For example, schizophrenia and affective illness are
also "organically" based, so the term <I>organic</I> is
ambiguous. Instead, in DSM-IV, the broader terms like <I>"cognitive
impairment"</I> and <I>"symptomatic"</I> are used. The cognitive
impairment
disorders include coarse neurobehavioral disorders like dementia and
delirium. For those conditions in DSM-IV that have
specific etiologies, the term <I>"symptomatic"</I> are used, so that we talk of
symptomatic delusional disorder when Vitamin B-12
deficiency may be causing a delusional condition (as opposed to the
current organic delusional disorder).
