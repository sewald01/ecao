<H1>Obesity Management</H1>

<P>
Obesity, like depression,  is an extremely important and common
epidemiologic condition.  Overweight requires pointers as to the point
when to pharmacologically intervene e.g. 20% above ideal body weight or
Body Mass Index of > 27-30.  Such pharmacological interventions are
logical as morbidity and mortality statistics support use of the
anorexigenic agents  always combined with the necessary elements of
calorie control, activity and change in eating habits. Such
prescriptions will  lower the overall risks more than the triad
management of pure diet, exercise and behavioral interventions without
drugs.
</P>

<P>
The link of serotonin receptors with appetite, craving and weight 
control is also important. Serotonin blocking agents such as 
cyproheptadine characteristically have been associated with weight 
gain and several antidepressant compounds such as the SSRI group and 
trazodone have at times been used in weight reduction although their 
effect is unpredictable. The exact receptor subtypes involved and 
mechanisms e.g. agonism or antagonism for weight control is unclear. 
Such data is confounded by approximately one third of patients with 
obesity having significant depressive disorder.
</P>

<P>
The development of anti-obesity agents such as dexfenfluramine (Redux)
raised fascinating serotonergic links for both appetite suppression and
selective carbohydrate craving and apparently markedly diminished the
risks of the norepinephric / amphetamine like effects of previous
compounds.  Dexfenfluramine is the active isomer of fenfluramine
(Pondamin) meaning that half the dose previously required could be taken
with the same effect and without the extra side-effects of the levo-
fenfluramine.  However,  unfortunately, these two drugs have been
withdrawn from the USA and possibly other markets because of questions
pertaining to heart valve lesions which may or may not be linked.
</P>

<P>
Because receptor subtype effects have not been well-studied the 
interaction of serotonin active drugs is complex and at times 
unclear. There are however good theoretical pointers suggesting 
reduced dosage with cautious combination  use only with the 
shorter acting antidepressants that do not overflow the serotonergic 
bathtub but which may have significant norepinephric effects.
