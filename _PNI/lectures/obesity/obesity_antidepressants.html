<P>
The current perspectives on depression and anxiety  and the entity of 
mixed anxiety depression are reviewed. Specialized groups such as 
addicts, medically ill and geriatric patients, have their own 
particular problems - relevant aspects are examined in the 
pharmacologic context. Special subdivisions lead to a more 
fruitful approach as to the patientâs pharmacologic needs.
</P>

<P>
Three clinical scenarios relate to patients who fail treatment 
after receiving selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drugs.  
Acutely, they may experience the "I'm  climbing out of my skin" 
feeling; more chronically over several weeks the "It's not working 
anymore" complaint; and over many months an "It worked so well 
before" amazement. This paper examines theoretical and practical 
options using <I>combination</I> serotonin antidepressant therapy 
and then looks at <I>new single drug</I> approaches as well as 
links with obesity.
</P>

<P>
A broader theory of management of depressed and obese patients can 
be developed with  the understanding of concepts such as 
<I>neuromodulation, partial agonism  and the serotonin bathtub 
analogy</I> in depression. The numerous antidepressant compounds 
are evaluated for side-effect profile with emphasis on serotonin 
excess symptoms. Serotonin modulates many basic functions at a 
large number of levels allowing explanations of why its influences 
are so diverse. In fact, it impacts at physiologic (circadian rhythms, 
hypothalamic pituitary function, temperature),  behavioral (aggression, 
<I>weight</I>, sex, sleep) and psychological (anxiety, 
<I>depression</I>, obsessionality, stress, memory, lability) 
levels. The numerous serotonin receptor subtypes and specificity 
is critical to appreciating why drugs work and fail and why such 
paradoxic reactions as anxiety or anti-anxiety effects may occur 
with the same drug in different patients.
</P>

<P>
Drug action at the <I>serotonin 1A</I> receptor subtype is 
particularly important. It involves <I>post-synaptic</I> 
effects in areas of the brain of strategic relevance to 
psychopathology. The azapirone class generally has apparent 
low toxicity, lack of dependency and sedation and selectivity at 
the Serotonin 1 A receptor with <I>partial agonism</I> making 
their potential application in psychiatry substantial. The only 
marketed 5HT-1A selective drug is the azapirone, buspirone 
(approved for use only in anxiety and mixed anxiety depressive 
states). However, clinical experience in several other areas is 
interesting but still at various early research stages. Serotonin 
re-uptake inhibitors like fluoxetine induce a serotonergic akathisia 
which can be blocked by buspirone. When SSRI compounds stop working 
with re-exacerbation of depression, adjunctive use of azapirones 
may theoretically extend their action. High therapeutic 
azapirone doses may also imply some modulation of obsessionality 
and weak antidepressant effects. The numerous antidepressant 
compounds are evaluated for side-effect profile with emphasis on 
serotonin excess symptoms.
</P>

<P>
The classic bathtub example relates to the serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitor drugs with their in general <I>unopposed effect of 
raising serotonin</I> levels: this is useful in treating a 
biological depression with ostensible serotonin deficiency.  
The model is simplistic because there are numerous receptor 
subtypes. <I>Serotonin 2A</I> receptor subtype is relevant as 
<I>blockade</I> appears to be linked with anti-depressant effects. 
The links of sexual libidinal and other side-effects, nausea, 
akathisia, anxiety, agitation, insomnia and headache may potentially 
be modulated by the serotonin excess induced by the SSRI drugs. 
Potentially drugs which have more moderate effects on serotonin 
re-uptake could diminish these effects, particularly if they have 
some serotonin blockade at relevant receptors such as 2A.
</P>

<P>
The unopposed action of serotonin without norepinephric effects in 
depression as in the classical SSRI model is examined and alternatives 
such as venlafaxine which involves <I>both receptors</I>. The 
limitations of this approach may relate to the dilemma of unopposed 
action or modulation. In this regard the development of a new 
antidepressant, nefazodone, theoretically is an exciting advance 
as <I>modulation not bathtub filling</I> can occur at both these 
receptor levels but predominantly at the serotonergic level. 
This should produce theoretically efficacy with less 
&quot;overfilling&quot; side-effects. Its bathplug effects such as 
substantial serotonin 2 A blockade produce the potential towards 
anti-anxiety action in the context of depression as well as some 
sedation implying applicability for the agitated depressed patient.
</P>

<P>
The advent of the azapirones and the new antidepressants such as 
nefazodone and venlafaxine has been a significant advance and may 
exemplify the neuromodulating roles played by varying doses of drug 
impinging on a specific receptors and the balance of blockade and 
re-uptake inhibition at serotonin and norepinephrine levels. 
Nefazodone and venlafaxine are examined as the new post-SSRI era 
drugs and fruitful alternatives to the SSRIs.
</P>

<P>
Obesity, like depression, is an extremely important and 
common epidemiologic condition. Overweight requires pointers as 
to the point when to pharmacologically intervene e.g. 20% 
above ideal body weight or Body Mass Index of &gt; 27-30. 
Such pharmacological interventions are logical as morbidity 
and mortality statistics support use of the anorexigenic agents 
always combined with the necessary elements of calorie control, 
activity and change in eating habits. Such prescriptions will 
lower the overall risks more than the triad management of pure 
diet, exercise and behavioral interventions without drugs.
</P>

<P>
The link of serotonin receptors with appetite, craving and weight 
control is also important. Serotonin blocking agents such as 
cyproheptadine characteristically have been associated with 
weight gain and several antidepressant compounds such as the 
SSRI group and trazodone have at times been used in weight 
reduction although their effect is unpredictable.  The exact 
receptor subtypes involved and mechanisms e.g. agonism or 
antagonism for weight control is unclear.  Such data is 
confounded by approximately one third of patients with obesity 
having significant depressive disorder.
</P>

<P>
The development of anti-obesity agents such as dexfenfluramine  have
raised fascinating serotonergic links for both appetite
suppression and selective carbohydrate craving and have markedly
diminished the risks of the norepinephric / amphetamine like effects of
previous compounds. Dexfenfluramine is the active isomer of
fenfluramine  meaning that half the dose previously required can be
taken with the same effect and without the extra side-effects of the
levo-fenfluramine.  Unfortunately, these two drugs have been withdrawn
from the USA and possibly other markets because of questions pertaining
to heart valve lesions which may or may not be linked.
</P>

<P>
Because receptor subtype effects have not been well-studied 
the interaction of serotonin active drugs is complex and at 
times unclear. There are however good theoretical pointers 
suggesting reduced dosage with cautious combination use only 
with the shorter acting antidepressants that do not overflow 
the serotonergic bathtub but which may have significant 
norepinephric effects.
