Abstract</H2>

The serotonin receptors modulate a variety of basic functions at a large

number of levels. These functions reflect serotonin 1A neuromodulators

as well. Because of the low toxicity, remarkable toleration, significant

experience in geropsychiatry and the medically ill, and the ostensible

lack of abuse, serotonin 1A related compounds have significant potential

application in geriatric psychiatry and medical illness.



<P>Serotonin 1A receptor action can be measured relatively specifically

by the azapirones. These act as partial agonists postsynaptically and full

agonists at the autoreceptor. Non-specifically, beta2 -adrenergic receptor

blockers (like propranolol) produce overall serotonin 1A receptor antagonist

effects. Beta-blockers have limited application in the elderly, despite

their role of serotonin 1A. The perspectives in akathisia and aggression

may be relevant. The benzodioxines, an experimental group, which includes

eltoprazine, act as partial agonists postsynaptically on both 5HT 1A and

1B receptors, and have potential application in aggression. Particularly

interesting is a possible link of the neural growth factor S100&szlig;

with serotonin 1A and Alzheimerâs disease.



<P>Specific serotonin modulators are evaluated using the azapirones as

the pharmacologic probe. Buspirone as the only marketed azapirone is approved

for use only in anxiety and mixed anxiety depressive states, however, clinical

experience in several other areas is interesting. Low doses of buspirone

probably act presynaptically as anti-aggressive agents and speculatively

help akathisia; medium doses act post-synaptically possibly as antagonists

modulating anxiety; higher doses are weak agonists and may correspond with

weak antidepressant effects, some modulation of obsessionality, and even

possible effects on the irritability of the manic. Such doses also may

induce mild akathisia: this may imply a serotonin 1A modulating role, but

this is complex as serotonin re-uptake blockers like fluoxetine which act

broadly also induce akathisia; moreover this can be blocked by buspirone.

Finally extremely high doses of buspirone appear very promising antitardive

dyskinesia agents: as these effects may be blocked by cyproheptadine, this

too may be via serotonin 1A neuromodulation of the known partial dopamine

agonist effects of buspirone in conventionally supra-therapeutic doses.
