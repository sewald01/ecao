<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The current classification of anxiety of a separation of panic 
and generalized anxiety disorder has historical and epidemiologic 
limitations. We review alternative perspectives of anxiety 
viewed along the normal - abnormal continuum , as well as the 
frameworks of somatic and psychic anxiety. Similarly, subdivisions 
into adjustment disorder, anxiety states, mixed anxiety / 
depression and organic anxiety disorder lead to a more fruitful 
approach as to the patientâs pharmacologic needs. Classification 
of irritability and aggression is limited by the lack of diagnoses 
in DSM3R, terminology confusion and unavailability of marketed 
drugs for aggression. Drugs for these indications should preferably 
be non-sedative, not induce dependence, be safe and have limited 
drug interactions, particularly in specialized groups such as 
addicts, medically ill and geriatric patients. Irritability is 
an especially difficult and common problem in the elderly, yet 
there are no approved agents for aggression or irritability.

One approach to anxiety involves a re-evaluation of past management 
to eliminate side-effects and develop customized treatment. Alcohol, 
bromides, barbiturates, meprobamate and the benzodiazepines have 
all had their problems. The benzodiazepines have benefits with 
selected but limited indications in anxiety because of amnesic 
effects and impairments of psychomotor responses (potential risks 
with driving and falls in the elderly). Benzodiazepines have no 
place in irritability.  Legitimate alternatives exist such as 
antidepressant in anxiety, and beta-adrenergic blockers and 
azapirones in both anxiety and irritability.

Psychopharmacology is rapidly approaching the age of specialized 
receptorology and serotonin subtypes play a major role in management 
of both anxiety and depression. The advent of the azapirones has 
been a significant advance and may exemplify the neuromodulating 
roles played by varying doses of drug impinging on a specific receptor, 
in this instance serotonin 1A. The azapirones are potent 
anti-aggressive and anti-anxiety agents in animal models probably 
via  components of their specific serotonin 1A effects. Irritability 
is an early target symptom of response with low-dose buspirone in 
generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, preliminary open experience 
suggests a low doses of buspirone (15-25 mg per day) is effective 
after a few days in alleviating irritability, anger and hostility 
without associated significant anxiety in three studies by the 
author - all statistically significant.  This data requires 
adequate controlled studies as buspirone as the only marketed 
azapirone is approved for use only in anxiety and mixed anxiety 
depressive states.
