<H2>Perspective</H2>

<P>
Exploration of aggression spectrum concepts such as anger, aggression, 
hostility, dyscontrol, rage, irritability and impulsivity are 
compromised by the absence of an adequate diagnostic and 
therapeutic classification, the general equivalent use of these terms, 
their measuring difficulties and their lack of research. Without a 
current diagnostic framework for aggression in the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual III revision or DSM-IV, there are no FDA approved 
drugs for aggression. Classification of irritability and aggression 
is therefore limited by the lack of diagnoses in DSM3R, terminology 
confusion and unavailability of marketed drugs for aggression.
</P>

<P>
The advent of the OBRA legislation has particularly limited the use 
of inappropriate medications in the elderly nursing home context. 
This has led to a marked diminution in prescription of neuroleptics 
such as haloperidol for agitation and anger in the geriatric setting. 
Similarly, benzodiazepines have become unpopular, with their 
potential for sedation, aggravating cognitive impairments, 
amnesic effects and impairments of psychomotor responses (potential 
risks with driving and falls in the elderly) and frank dependence. 
Alcohol is still a poor self-prescribed alternative, and bromides, 
barbiturates and meprobamate have had benefits far outweighed by 
their risks such that they no longer have a place in geriatrics 
and they also have no place in irritability management. 
Legitimate alternatives exist such as antidepressants but the 
tricyclics are limited by anticholinergic side-effects and 
cardiotoxicity and the mono-amine oxidase inhibitors by their 
dietary dangers. Both groups are unproven in straight agitation 
without depression.
</P>

<P>
Geriatric drugs for irritability, impulsivity, anger, agitation 
and aggression should preferably be non-sedative, not induce 
dependence, be safe and have limited drug interactions, particularly 
in specialized groups such as addicts, medically ill and geriatric 
patients. Irritability is an especially difficult and common 
problem in the elderly, yet there are no approved agents for 
aggression or irritability. The past few years has led to an 
increasing emphasis on use of safer alternatives. Additionally, one 
approach to irritability and agitation management involves a 
re-evaluation of past management to eliminate side-effects and 
develop customized treatment.
</P>

<P>
Drugs such as carbamazepine have enormous potential in the 
management of episodic disorders particularly those linked with 
hostility. Preliminary research suggests its use is particularly 
apposite in &quot;Paroxysmal Neurobehavioral Disorders&quot; 
as a prototype organic illness with epilepsy like phenomena. 
Unfortunately, it does have significant sedative effects in the 
elderly and will work well only in a minority subpopulation.
</P>

<P>
Psychopharmacology is rapidly approaching the age of specialized 
receptorology and serotonin subtypes play a major role in 
management of both anxiety and depression, both of which are 
commonly linked with irritability and agitation. Moreover, evidence
exists for serotonin receptor involvement in the aggression 
spectrum using animal models and human clinical and post-mortem 
studies.
</P>

<P>
The serotonin receptors modulate a variety of basic functions 
at a large number of levels. These functions reflect serotonin 1A 
neuromodulators as well. Because of the low toxicity, remarkable 
toleration, significant experience in geropsychiatry and the 
medically ill, and the ostensible lack of abuse, serotonin 1A 
related compounds have significant potential application in 
geriatric psychiatry and medical illness.
</P>

<P>
Serotonin 1A receptor action can be measured relatively specifically 
by the azapirones. These act as partial agonists postsynaptically 
and full agonists at the autoreceptor. Non-specifically, 
beta2-adrenergic receptor blockers (like propranolol) produce 
overall serotonin 1A receptor antagonist effects. Beta-blockers 
have limited application in the elderly, despite their role of 
serotonin 1A. The perspectives in akathisia and aggression may be 
relevant. The benzodioxines act as partial agonists postsynaptically 
on both 5HT 1A and 1B receptors, and have potential application 
in aggression. Particularly interesting is a possible link of 
the neural growth factor S100&szlig; with serotonin 1A and Alzheimerâs disease.
</P>

<P>
Beta-adrenergic blockers are useful but to a limited degree 
because of side-effects in high doses in organic populations. 
This limits their use in the geriatric context. Biphasic effects 
are seen with the lipid soluble propranolol - low doses probably 
relate to simple alleviation of frustration, but, high doses 
seem to have a central, possibly non-beta effect. Their action 
may have links with serotonin 1A or 1B. An alternative more 
likely mechanism may relate to down regulation of serotonin 2 - a 
mechanism which may take weeks and may explain the delayed 
effects of propranolol in rage including geriatric organic patients.
</P>

<P>
A new unmarketed group, the benzodioxines, epitomized currently by 
eltoprazine, also has actions linked to serotonin 1A or 1B- but 
likely serotonin 1A in man because 1B receptors probably do not 
exist in primates. This may be the group of the future.
</P>

<P>
Additionally, lithium cation is commonly used in similar populations 
for affective illness and aggression has serotonin 1A agonist 
effects. Lithium's action may be diverse but its use in non-bipolar 
elderly patients is limited by toxicity.
</P>

<P>
Animal models of aggression suggest the azapirones are potent 
anti-aggressive agents. This should be via components of their 
specific serotonin 1A partial agonist effects. Irritability is an 
early target symptom of response with buspirone in generalized 
anxiety disorder possibly implying persistent low-dose effects. 
The advent of the azapirones has been a significant advance and 
may exemplify the neuromodulating roles played by varying doses 
of drug impinging on a specific receptor, in this instance 
serotonin 1A. The azapirones are potent anti-aggressive and 
anti-anxiety agents in animal models probably via components of 
their specific serotonin 1A effects. Irritability is an early 
target symptom of response with low-dose buspirone in generalized 
anxiety disorder.
</P>

<P>
In our earliest study, open experience suggests a biphasic dose 
effect for buspirone: Low doses of buspirone (15-25 mg per day) 
were effective after a few days in alleviating irritability, 
anger and hostility without associated significant anxiety in nine 
successive inpatients (p&lt;0.001, but many inpatients improve with 
milieu) and a further 11 outpatients. Higher doses such as 60-90 mg 
per day almost immediately greatly relieved manic irritability, 
agitation, restlessness and mood lability in ten subjects. If real, 
these two effects can be explained in a unified serotonin theory. 
Subsequently, our database has enlarged enormously both for low and 
high dose buspirone and we have a series with geriatric patients as 
well.  This data requires adequate controlled studies as buspirone 
as the only marketed azapirone is approved for use only in anxiety 
and mixed anxiety depressive states.
</P>

<P>
The use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors for anger is 
controversial at best. Fluoxetine because of its long half life 
could be argued to be absolutely contra-indicated in the geriatric 
context. Sertraline and paroxetine are unproven but may have a 
place in the retarded depressive who exhibits episodic anger. 
However, because of their non-specific serotonin receptor effects 
the theoretical potential for paradoxic reactions (which can also 
rarely occur with buspirone) should be noted. Trazodone may be the 
most logical antidepressant in geriatric agitated depressives, 
but hypotension should be watched for by giving the lowest 
possible doses.
</P>

<P>
Geriatric psychopharmacology should be seen as an important 
adjunct to behavioral interventions in both episodic conditions 
such as agitation and irritability as well as in more chronic 
impairments like dementia and depression. In this regard we have 
recently developed a promising measure to monitor inpatients, 
the Problem Behaviors Rating Scale, which has been particularly 
adapted for geriatric use.
