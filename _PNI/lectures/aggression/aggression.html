<H1>Pharmacologic Management of Aggression and Irritability</H1>

<P>Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD</P>

<H3>EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES:</H3>

<P>
To educate in the area of aggression in the context of anxiety and 
depression and to discuss the clinical implications with regard to 
management options and problems.
</P>

<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>

<P>
Exploration of aggression spectrum concepts such as anger, aggression, 
hostility, dyscontrol, rage, irritability and impulsivity are 
compromised by the absence of an adequate diagnostic and therapeutic 
classification, the general equivalent use of these terms, their 
measuring difficulties and their lack of research. Without a current 
diagnostic framework for aggression in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual III revision or DSM-IV, there are no FDA approved drugs for 
aggression.
</P>

<P>
Drugs such as carbamazepine have enormous potential in the management 
of episodic disorders particularly those linked with hostility. 
Preliminary research suggests its use is particularly apposite in 
&quot;Paroxysmal Neurobehavioral Disorders&quot; 
as a prototype organic illness with epilepsy like phenomena. While this 
aggression may occur incidentally in the context of anxiety and 
depression, this is not necessarily more frequent than other 
conditions.
</P>

<P>
Probably more important for anxiety and depression is the frustration 
aggression context linked with adrenergic and serotonergic elements.
</P>

<P>
Evidence exists for serotonin receptor involvement in the aggression 
spectrum using animal models and human clinical and post-mortem studies.
</P>

<P>
Beta-adrenergic blockers are useful but to a limited degree because of 
side-effects in high doses in organic populations. Biphasic effects are 
seen with the lipid soluble propranolol - low doses probably relate to 
simple alleviation of frustration, but, high doses seem to have a 
central, possibly non-beta effect. Their action may have links with 
serotonin 1A or 1B, and so may a new unmarketed group, the Benzodioxines. 
Additionally, lithium cation is commonly used in similar populations 
for affective illness and aggression has serotonin 1A agonist effects.
</P>

<P>
Animal models of aggression suggest the azapirones are potent 
anti-aggressive agents. This should be via components of their specific 
serotonin 1A partial agonist effects. Irritability is an early target 
symptom of response with buspirone in generalized anxiety disorder 
possibly implying persistent low-dose effects.
</P>

<P>
Early preliminary open experience suggests a biphasic dose effect for 
buspirone: Low doses of buspirone (15-25 mg per day) were effective 
after a few days in alleviating irritability, anger and hostility 
without associated significant anxiety in nine successive patients 
(p&lt; 0.001, but many inpatients improve with milieu). Higher doses 
such as 60-90 mg per day  almost immediately greatly relieved manic 
irritability, agitation, restlessness and mood lability in ten subjects. 
This data requires adequate controlled studies. If real, these two 
effects can be explained in a unified serotonin theory.
