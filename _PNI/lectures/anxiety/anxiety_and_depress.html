<H1>The Management of Mixed Anxiety and Depression</H1>

<P>Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD</P>

<H2>Educational Objectives</H2>

<P>
To educate in the area of mixed anxiety and depression and to 
discuss the clinical implications with regard to management options 
and problems.
</P>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The current classification of anxiety of a separation of panic and 
generalized anxiety disorder has historical and epidemiologic limitations. 
We review alternative perspectives of anxiety viewed along the normal - 
abnormal continuum, as well as the frameworks of somatic and psychic 
anxiety. Similarly, subdivisions into adjustment disorder, anxiety states, 
mixed anxiety / depression and organic anxiety disorder lead to a more 
fruitful approach as to the patientâs pharmacologic needs.
</P>

<P>
Depression co-exists with anxiety in about four-fifths of cases and 
one third of diagnosed anxiety has co-existent depression. This 
implies that there is a legitimate mixed anxiety depression condition.
</P>

<P>
Future innovative approaches to anxiety and depression paradoxically 
imply a re-evaluation of management over the last century to eliminate 
side-effects and develop customized treatment. Alcohol, bromides, 
barbiturates and meprobamate have all had their problems. The 
benzodiazepines, an apparent major advance, have turned out to have 
benefits with selected but limited indications for anxiety. This is 
so because of their significant problems.
</P>

<P>
Legitimate alternatives for anxiety such as antidepressant, 
beta-adrenergic blockers and azapirones are examined. Specialized 
groups such as addicts, medically ill and geriatric patients, have 
their own particular problems. Psychopharmacology is rapidly 
approaching the age of specialized receptorology and serotonin 
subtypes play a major role in management of both anxiety and 
depression. The advent of the azapirones has been a significant 
advance and may exemplify the neuromodulating roles played by varying 
doses of drug impinging on a specific receptor, in this instance 
serotonin 1A.
</P>

<P>
The development of the tricyclic antidepressants with newer 
heterocyclic compounds have major implications for the 
anxiety-depression spectrum. At times, the two conditions need to be 
appropriately balanced in the context of rational polypharmacy.
