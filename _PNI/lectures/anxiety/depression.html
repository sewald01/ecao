<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The current perspectives on depression and anxiety and the entity of 
mixed anxiety depression are reviewed. Depression and anxiety 
manifestations are differentiated but they strongly overlap. We review 
special perspectives viewed along the frameworks of somatic and 
psychic anxiety, and cognitive and vegetative features of depression. 
Specialized groups such as addicts, medically ill and geriatric 
patients, have their own particular problems - relevant aspects are 
examined in the pharmacologic context. Special subdivisions lead to a 
more fruitful approach as to the patientâs pharmacologic needs. 
Legitimate approaches are examined.
</P>

<P>
The numerous antidepressant compounds are evaluated for side-effect 
profile with emphasis on serotonin excess symptoms. Serotonin modulates 
many basic functions at a large number of levels allowing explanations 
of such conundrums as the delayed effects of antidepressants. Finally 
receptor specificity is critical to appreciating why drugs work and fail.
</P>

<P>
Three clinical scenarios relate to patients who fail treatment after 
receiving selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drugs.  Acutely, 
they may experience the "I'm  climbing out of my skin" feeling; more 
chronically over several weeks the "It's not working anymore" complaint; 
and over many months an "It worked so well before" amazement. 
Psychopharmacology is rapidly approaching the age of specialized 
receptorology and serotonin subtypes play a major role in management 
of both anxiety and depression. A broader theory of management of such 
patients can be developed with  the understanding of concepts such as 
neuromodulation, partial agonism and the serotonin bathtub analogy. 
Serotonin modulates many basic functions at a large number of levels 
allowing explanations of such conundrums as the delayed effects of 
antidepressants. Finally receptor specificity is critical to appreciating 
why drugs work and fail. Drug action at the serotonin 1A receptor subtype 
is particularly important. Theoretical and practical options using 
combination serotonin antidepressant therapy are still at various early 
research stages, such as fluoxetine induced serotonergic akathisia 
which can be blocked by buspirone; or when SSRI compounds stop working 
with re-exacerbation of depression, adjunctive use of azapirones may 
theoretically extend their action.
</P>

<P>
The advent of the azapirones and the new antidepressants such as 
nefazodone and venlafaxine has been a significant advance and may 
exemplify the neuromodulating roles played by varying doses of drug 
impinging on a specific receptors and the balance of blockade and 
re-uptake inhibition at serotonin and norepinephrine levels. Nefazodone 
and venlafaxine are examined as fruitful alternatives to the SSRIs.
