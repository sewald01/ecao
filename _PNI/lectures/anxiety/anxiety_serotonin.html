<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The current classification of anxiety of a separation of panic 
and generalized anxiety disorder has historical and epidemiologic 
limitations with new terms being developed for old concepts and a 
statistical interface between the two conditions. An alternative 
perspectives is viewing anxiety along the normal - abnormal continuum, 
as well as the frameworks of somatic and psychic anxiety. Similarly, 
subdivisions into adjustment disorder, anxiety states, mixed 
anxiety / depression and organic anxiety disorder lead to a more 
fruitful approach as to the patientâs pharmacologic needs. The 
frustration spectrum with irritability is an important components. 
We do not have a classification of irritability: At times, anger and 
related affects are closely linked with frustration and anxiety but 
such symptoms may exist separately too.
</P>

<P>
Future innovative approaches to anxiety paradoxically imply a 
re-evaluation of management over the last century to eliminate 
side-effects and develop customized treatment. Alcohol, bromides, 
barbiturates and meprobamate have all had their problems. The 
benzodiazepines, an apparent major advance, have turned out to have 
benefits with selected but limited indications. This is so because 
of their significant problems.
</P>

<P>
The rare electrical mechanisms may explain responsiveness to 
anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine in certain episodic - 
atypical panic - anxieties. The adrenergic, GABA / chloride ionophore 
receptor and serotonergic bathtub theories of pharmacologic 
mechanism are important frameworks for usage of such drugs as the 
beta-adrenergic blockers, benzodiazepines and selective serotonin 
re-uptake inhibitors (with their paradoxic side-effects of anxiety and 
agitation). Serotonin 1 A agonism and 2 A blockade introduce mechanisms 
for azapirones and such drugs as trazodone, risperidone, 
phenothiazines and nefazodone.
</P>

<P>
Legitimate alternatives such as antidepressant, beta-adrenergic 
blockers and azapirones are examined. Specialized groups such as 
addicts, medically ill and geriatric patients, have their own 
particular problems. Psychopharmacology is rapidly approaching the 
age of specialized receptorology and serotonin subtypes play a major 
role in management of both anxiety and depression. The advent of the 
azapirones has been a significant advance and may exemplify the 
neuromodulating roles played by varying doses of drug impinging on a 
specific receptor, in this instance serotonin 1A.
</P>

<P>
Animal models of aggression suggest the azapirones are potent 
anti-aggressive agents.  This should be via components of their specific 
serotonin 1A partial agonist effects. Irritability is an early target 
symptom of response with buspirone in generalized anxiety disorder 
possibly implying persistent low-dose effects. Early preliminary open 
experience by the author suggests low doses of buspirone (15-25 mg per day) 
were effective after a few days in alleviating irritability, anger and 
hostility without associated significant anxiety in inpatients and 
outpatients plus a series of children and adolescents with similar 
results. Strangely, higher doses such as 60-90 mg per day  almost 
immediately greatly relieved manic irritability, agitation, restlessness 
and mood lability in ten subjects. This data requires adequate 
controlled studies. If real, these two effects can be explained in a 
unified serotonin theory.
