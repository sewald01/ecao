<H2>Educational Objectives</H2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    To educate in the area of anxiety and depression and to 
    demonstrate areas of similarity and differences.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To discuss the clinical implications with regard to 
    management options and problems.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    The development of a broader theory of innovative 
    psychopharmacotherapy and the understanding of concepts such 
    as neuromodulation using the bathtub analogy and partial 
    agonism.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To discuss the clinical and theoretical frameworks for enhancing 
    the effects of antidepressants in cases of clinical 
    refractoriness and side-effects.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To focus these theories on the female patient with 
    consideration of premenstrual, pregnancy, post-partum situations 
    and the pot-menopausal frameworks.

<P>
The incidence of depression lifetime in women is 1 in 4. About 80% of 
depression are associated with a yet more common condition, anxiety. 
Women may be more predisposed to these conditions at special times 
namely premenstrually, during pregnancy, post-partum situations and 
the post-menopausally. Each of these have unique elements. Anxiety 
and depression in women is unique as well as generalizable to 
male experience.
</P>

<P>
The current classifications of anxiety and depression has historical 
and epidemiologic limitations. Depression and anxiety manifestations 
are separate and differentiated but they strongly overlap.
</P>

<P>
We review special perspectives viewed along the normal - abnormal 
continuum, as well as the frameworks of somatic and psychic anxiety, 
and cognitive and vegetative features of depression. Similarly, 
special subdivisions lead to a more fruitful approach as to the 
patientâs pharmacologic needs.
</P>

<P>
Legitimate approaches such as antidepressant, azapirone (buspirone) 
and beta-adrenergic blockers are examined. Specialized groups such as 
addicts, medically ill and geriatric patients, have their own particular 
problems.
</P>

<P>
Three clinical scenarios relate to patients who fail treatment after 
receiving selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drugs.  Acutely, 
they may experience the "I'm climbing out of my skin" feeling; 
more chronically over several weeks the "It's not working anymore" 
complaint; and over many months an "It worked so well before" amazement. 
This paper examines theoretical and practical options using combination 
serotonin antidepressant therapy. Buspirone is the only marketed 
azapirone (approved for use only in anxiety and mixed anxiety 
depressive states). However, clinical experience in several other areas 
is interesting but still at various early research stages, such as 
serotonin re-uptake inhibitors like fluoxetine induce a 
serotonergic akathisia which can be blocked by buspirone; or when SSRI 
compounds stop working with re-exacerbation of depression, adjunctive 
use of azapirones may theoretically extend their action.
</P>

<P>
Psychopharmacology is rapidly approaching the age of specialized 
receptorology and serotonin subtypes play a major role in management 
of both anxiety and depression. The advent of the azapirones and the 
new antidepressants such as nefazodone and venlafaxine has been a 
significant advance and may exemplify the neuromodulating roles played 
by varying doses of drug impinging on a specific receptors like 
serotonin 1A and the balance of blockade and re-uptake inhibition at 
serotonin and norepinephrine levels. Nefazodone and venlafaxine are 
examined as fruitful alternatives to the SSRIs.
</P>

<P>
A broader theory of management of such patients can be developed with 
the understanding of concepts such as neuromodulation, partial agonism 
and the serotonin bathtub analogy. Moreover, serotonin modulates 
many basic functions at a large number of levels allowing explanations 
of such conundrums as the delayed effects of antidepressants. Finally 
receptor specificity is critical to appreciating why drugs work and 
fail.
