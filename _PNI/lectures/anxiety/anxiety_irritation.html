<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The current classification of anxiety of a separation of panic and 
generalized anxiety disorder has historical and epidemiologic 
limitations. We review alternative perspectives of anxiety viewed 
along the normal - abnormal continuum, as well as the frameworks of 
somatic and psychic anxiety. Similarly, subdivisions into adjustment 
disorder, anxiety states, mixed anxiety / depression and organic 
anxiety disorder lead to a more fruitful approach as to the 
patientâs pharmacologic needs. We do not have a classification of 
irritability: At times, anger and related affects are closely linked 
with frustration and anxiety but such symptoms may exist separately 
too.
</P>

<P>
Future innovative approaches to anxiety paradoxically imply a 
re-evaluation of management over the last century to eliminate 
side-effects and develop customized treatment. Alcohol, bromides, 
barbiturates and meprobamate have all had their problems. The 
benzodiazepines, an apparent major advance, have turned out to have 
benefits with selected but limited indications. This is so because 
of their significant problems.
</P>

<P>
Legitimate alternatives such as antidepressant, beta-adrenergic 
blockers and azapirones are examined. Specialized groups such as 
addicts, medically ill and geriatric patients , have their own 
particular problems. Psychopharmacology is rapidly approaching the 
age of specialized receptorology and serotonin subtypes play a major 
role in management of both anxiety and depression. The advent of 
the azapirones has been a significant advance and may exemplify 
the neuromodulating roles played by varying doses of drug impinging 
on a specific receptor, in this instance serotonin 1A.
</P>

<P>
Animal models of aggression suggest the azapirones are potent 
anti-aggressive agents. This should be via components of their 
specific serotonin 1A partial agonist effects. Irritability is an 
early target symptom of response with buspirone in generalized 
anxiety disorder possibly implying  persistent low-dose effects.
</P>

<P>
Early preliminary open experience by the author suggests low doses 
of buspirone (15-25 mg per day) were effective after a few days 
in alleviating irritability, anger and hostility without associated 
significant anxiety in nine successive inpatients (p&lt; 0.001, but 
many inpatients improve with milieu) and a further 11 outpatients 
in one study; thereafter 29 patients were studied plus a series of 
children and adolescents with similar results. Strangely, higher doses 
such as 60-90 mg per day almost immediately greatly relieved manic 
irritability, agitation, restlessness and mood lability in ten 
subjects. This data requires adequate controlled studies. If real, 
these two effects can be explained in a unified serotonin theory.
