<H1>Suggestions for Lectures</H1>

<P>Vernon M  Neppe  MD, PhD</P>

<P>
The following list is to assist in allowing as successful a meeting as possible. 
Like you, I want the lecture to be worthwhile and to run smoothly.
These guidelines have developed out of lengthy travel and lecture experience 
and reflect what works for me.
</P>

<P>Please obtain the following information from your visiting faculty:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>a list of all my lectures</LI>

  <LI>
    this also includes suggestions for different groups; please note I 
    talk to groups of any size (one on one to enormous conferences or symposia) 
    and to psychiatrists, family practitioners, pediatricians, internists, 
    neurologists and others.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    CME accreditation: goals of lecture, abstract. Please do not distribute 
    <U>all</U> the abstracts to physicians. Give them the titles of lectures and 
    if required specific abstracts.
  </LI>

  <LI>a curriculum vitae of more than 20 pages</LI>
  <LI>an abbreviated 3-4 page biosketch - usually most suitable</LI>
  <LI>a half page introduction</LI>
</OL>


<H2>SETTING UP OF LECTURES</H2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    Please note that with rare exceptions, <I>at least three talks per 
    day</I> should be arranged - beginning at breakfast, then lunch and 
    dinner (Fridays generally two ending at lunch time). Please confirm with 
    visiting faculty. I have done on occasion up to five talks in a day.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    It is seldom practical to fly through the night to a city that 
    cannot be reached nonstop. Often, a breakfast lecture can be set 
    up in a city I need to fly through and not in your city.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <I>Lectures should be paired</I> (e.g. lunch and dinner) <I>in the 
    same broad geographic locality</I> - (e.g. not more than forty minutes 
    apart and not requiring a plane: otherwise the travel is too exhausting 
    and time demanding). Plane connections may make exact timing critical.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Sometimes a hotel day room is valuable in this regard: shopping 
    around in the area for hotels which offer this is sometimes difficult.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Please note that I speak to very varied audiences ranging from 
    high level academics (and lecturing at a medical school is always an 
    added pleasure to me) to primary care physicians and pharmacists, 
    and even physicians assistants and nurses. The same topic may be entirely 
    different for each group. Sometimes, my audience consists of specialized 
    medical groups like psychiatrists, pediatricians, neurologists, 
    cardiologists, internists, gynecologists. It is critical that I know 
    who my audience is. It is equally critical to know the length of 
    the talk.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>Please note that I can generally only confirm lectures once 
    the required number (e.g. three in a day) have been set up.</B>
    <I>Once I have confirmed I am coming, my patients for that day are 
    canceled and, in addition, I run very significant expenses at my 
    institute (without salary). Please do not cancel without substituting 
    a new lecture in a convenient locale - not a hundred miles away: in 
    any event, I still require payment for canceled lectures as I am 
    allocating that time.</I> (Visiting faculty rules relate to 
    cancellation within a week of the lecture or coming to the place 
    as a consequence of lectures promised).
  </LI>

<H2>LECTURE PROGRAMS / NOTIFICATIONS TO PHYSICIANS:</H2>

I suggest this format for cards / invitations to lectures (do not use an 
old resume!).

<H2>THE ACTUAL LECTURE</H2>


<H3>APPARATUS FOR THE ACTUAL LECTURE:</H3>

<P>
For all lectures please ensure the following basic apparatus:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    One standard (i.e. <U>Kodak / Ectographic</U>) slide projector
    (non-standard ones such as Vivitar should not be used - check with 
    restaurants or hospitals if they are supplying the projector).
    <B>A screen</B>is obviously necessary: however, one can frequently use 
    the wall.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>Remote control with <U>remote control extension</U>.</B>
    (If renting, ask for one; this is a twenty food cord that 
    attaches to the remote control and is commonly forgotten)
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>Extension cord with plug for sockets of 3 or 2 holes</B>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B><U>Microphone unless room is very small</U>. (I cannot 
    overemphasize this enough; please obtain if you have any doubt; 
    I deliberately modulate my voice down to a whisper at times).</B>
    Please preserve my voice for my other lectures. As a guide, 
    any room accommodating more than 30 people or any room where 
    my voice projects more than 20 feet would qualify).
  </LI>

  <LI><B>Spare light bulb.</B></LI>

  <LI>
    <B>Laser pointer.</B> I often have one with me. However, 
    they break quickly and are liable to get lost.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>I generally have spare remotes and extension cords.</B> 
    However, the rate of attrition is very high.
  </LI>

  <P>
    The most common pieces of apparatus forgotten are remote 
    extension for the remote control, microphone, laser pointer, 
    using a Vivitar projector not a Kodak, no extension cord or 
    3 to 2 point plug.
  </P>
</OL>

<H3>Time of arrival for the lecture:</H3>

<P>
I do not generally need to arrive a half-hour before a lecture. 
Fifteen minutes is invariably sufficient.  My slides will be ready 
to go. The only limitation is ensuring that there is a slide 
projector available which is in working order. Similarly, it would be 
appreciated not to have to be part of collecting the food prior to 
the lecture or stopping over to visit with doctors whom representatives 
call on (which is not acceptable).
</P>

<H3>Introducing me:</H3>

<P>
If the representative introduces me, it may be perceived as a 
compromise to the presentationâs objectivity: this is not preferred. 
Depending on formality, I prefer to be introduced by one of the 
physicians or by the director of CME. If this is unsuitable, I can 
introduce myself.
</P>

<H3>LUNCH and BREAKFAST PRESENTATIONS:</H3>

<P>
Generally, a significant time crunch occurs - a set starting time is 
important for the 50-60 minutes long lecture. If fixed meals or 
pre-ordering can be done, this will facilitate greatly.
</P>


<H3>EVENING LECTURES:</H3>

<P>
The length of talks in the evening varies but generally runs about 
1.5 hours or longer with questions. <U>Please ensure therefore that 
dinner is served during the lecture.</U> If there is a dessert or 
coffee this should be during the lecture. Frequently, salads or 
appetizers should be served before the start of the lecture which 
should begin generally either at 7 PM (most common: this usually 
requires seating at 6.50 PM and if waiters are taking the orders at 
6.45 PM ) or at 6.30 PM. Whereas a lecture can be advertised as 
6.30 PM for drinks, the starting time should be clearly indicated. 
<U>Please do not indicate an end time.</U>

<H3>PERMIT ME SOME OBSERVATIONS WITH REGARD TO LECTURES:</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>
    <B>Some physicians do not eat meat (including poultry).</B> I 
    suggest you consider a non-exotic alternative e.g. regular fish 
    like salmon or trout (not oysters or shark) or vegetarian.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>Many physicians prefer juices or diet plus decaffeinated drinks</B>
    to regular drinks.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>More physicians will attend if their spouses are invited.</B>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>Most representatives feel that they themselves benefited greatly 
    from the lecture. I strongly encourage attendance by 
    representatives.</B> (Sometimes, the most valuable single aspect to 
    the lecture is the confidence a representative obtains by 
    attending speakers lectures. Please do not ignore this. It is far 
    more important than seeing that one extra physician).
  </LI>
</OL>


<H2>BASIC ARRANGEMENTS TO FACILITATE MEETING AND LECTURE</H2>

<H3>PRIOR TO MY DEPARTURE OR IF ON THE ROAD, THE PREVIOUS DAY:</H3>

<P>
Please ensure that I know which hotel I am staying in. I must also 
know where and when I am speaking.
</P>

<H3>OUT OF HOURS ARRIVALS:</H3>

<P>
I do not expect to be picked up at airports late at night or early 
in the morning. I will take a cab or limo as needed. However, 
please ensure that taxis are available in little towns. Limos 
between cities are generally cheaper than taxis and they should 
preferably originate from the <I>city of origin</I> not the city of 
destination (otherwise they can arrive very late).
</P>

<H3>HOTEL ROOMS:</H3>

<P>
Please ensure that you have reserved a hotel room for me so there 
will be no ambiguity as to where I am staying. If you have 
guaranteed the booking on your credit card, I will change it to my 
credit card once I arrive.
</P>

<P>
It is often best to aim at a hotel near the following dayâs breakfast 
meeting rather than at the venue of the evening before. This 
facilitates avoiding traffic congestion in the morning.
</P>

<P>
If a meeting is organized at a particular hotel that hotel is obviously 
preferable. Otherwise, most commonly, I stay at Hiltons or Sheratons.
</P>

<P>
You may book the cheapest rates in single occupancy, non-smoking: 
corporate rates often require booking at the time of reservation.
</P>

<P>
Hotel accommodation is not necessarily best in one place for a 
whole trip. Please discuss these options with me.
</P>

<H3>TIME BETWEEN LECTURES AND DAY ROOMS:</H3>

<P>
The success of any venture is partly dependent on my utilizing time 
appropriately.  Invariably, there are several urgent medical 
matters that I need deal with between talks and work to be done 
between lectures. Please ensure that there is as little dead time 
as possible between talks. For example, if there is a lunch at 12-1 pm 
and a dinner at 6.30 pm in the same town, I will generally need a hotel 
room for that afternoon:  the choice therefore is getting a day room at 
a hotel for the 5 hours dead time or even better to stay over in that 
city and check into a new hotel. This requires packing anyway. 
Decisions are muddied if the lecture the next morning is in a different 
city where usually it is logical to stay over in that new city.  Often, 
such choices are close calls and it would be worth discussing with me 
<B>prior to my travels</B>.
</P>

<H3>MEETING AT THE AIRPORT</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>
    If you are picking me up at the airport please let me know. 
  </LI>

  <LI>
    For recognition purposes, you may want to wear an identification.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    I am of medium height, bespectacled, clean shaven with brown hair 
    and will probably be <I>wheeling</I> two small cases e.g. 1 gray 
    and 1 green.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    The best place to meet is at the gate at which my flight arrives.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    If <U>you cannot locate me</U> (very rare) please:
  </LI>

  <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>overhead page me.</LI>

    <LI>
      page me on my pager by 1(800) 946-4646 and enter the pin #547 4814 
      and your phone number. (<I>Usually this will not work until my 800 number 
      is connected to the new city</I>)
    </LI>

    <LI>
      phone me at my home number 1(206) 526-5012 and leave a message.
    </LI>

    <P>
      Meanwhile, I may overhead page or phone your home or car phone 
      if available.
    </P>
  </OL>

  <P>
    Finally, <I>please let me know where the lecture is taking place 
    and how far away it is</I>, so that as a last resort, I could take a 
    cab to the lecture.
  </P>
</OL>


<H3>THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MORNING LECTURE:</H3>

<P>Please leave a message at the hotel about:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>what time you are picking me up</LI>
  <LI>the title of the talk and</LI>

  <LI>
    the broad audience e.g. psychiatrists OR internists OR mixed OR 
    family practice plus <I>spouses</I> OR non-medical (nurses, social 
    workers) and psychiatrists. Please do this even if you have spoken 
    to me the day before as notes will be on my computer but at 2 am in 
    the morning it may not be optimal to plug in a computer to check 
    such data. Please note that I may give a very different lecture on 
    the same title to different audiences.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Please leave me a contact phone number. Car phone numbers are very 
    useful though seldom used.
  </LI>
</OL>

<H3>AT TIME OF PICK UP AT THE HOTEL</H3>

<P>When I am picked up at a hotel for the lecture:</P>

<P>
<B>Please call up to my room</B>: if I am not there check in the 
lobby or check at the breakfast restaurant and let the reception 
know you are waiting for me. (Occasionally, I am in the lobby and 
so is the representative and we do not see each other.)
</P>

<P>It is a good idea to wear a name badge.</P>

<P>
<B>It is preferable to call my room so I may receive phone messages 
in emergencies.</B>
</P>

<P>
Sometimes, to save time, I need to check out prior to your 
arrival: still call my room or check in the lobby; I have 
not left!
</P>

<H3>PAGING:</H3>

<P>
I may have access to an 800 pager and you may page me while traveling. 
If so, I will let you know.  If you are in the hotel lobby you may enter 
9999 and I will know you are there.
</P>

<H3>CONTENTS OF LECTURES</H3>

<P>
As indicated, please note that I have given the Visiting Faculty a listing 
of all the lectures I do. These are listed below under topic titles. 
Please obtain these from Visiting Faculty directly. Every lecture 
has a: 
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    <B>series of educational objectives for when continuing medical 
    education is given.</B>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>one page abstract which may be given to physicians on request.</B>
    Additionally, a summary page suggests topic titles for different 
    audiences and a separate sheet lists the educational objectives of all 
    the talks together so that directors of education may choose which lecture 
    they want.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <B>Representatives will benefit from discussing the exact topic for 
    each group with me. Often this may lead to a suggested more suitable 
    topic.</B>
  </LI>
</OL>

<H3>BIOGRAPHICAL DATA:</H3>

<P>
I have given your visiting faculty several different
<A HREF="http://www.pni.org/neppe/intro.shtml">biosketches</A>. 
</P>

<P>
The first is a half page introduction to introduce me by the chairman 
of the meeting. The second is a four page biosketch which can be used 
effectively for CME accreditation. The third is a detailed curriculum 
vitae of 20-30 pages. Please obtain these from Visiting Faculty 
directly or the world wide web.

<P>
I commonly encounter the situation where the representative even at the 
time of the lecture is uncertain of the exact title or less commonly 
has the title frankly wrong. To facilitate that I travel with the 
correct sets of slides, I appeal to you to complete the enclosed sheet. 
Sometimes, the population is specialized e.g. in women, in the elderly, 
in children and adolescents, in the mental hospital context, in the 
medically ill, in cardiology etc. This is not usually a problem, 
provided I know about it, so please mention it.
