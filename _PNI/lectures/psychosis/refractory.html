<B>Non-responsive psychosis</B> refers to a chronic non-neuroleptic 
responsive psychosis. "Non-responsive psychosis" is the author's 
term for patients with a history of a hallucinatory-delusional 
condition who have not returned to their pre-morbid level of 
functioning despite adequate neuroleptization for a minimum 
period of at least one year. The term is thus non-specific and 
descriptive including as a subgroup chronic schizophrenics. 
This encompasses far more than typical deteriorating schizophrenia 
as many non-responsive psychotics are not schizophrenic. We should 
seek out and manage "non-responsive" psychotics who do not exhibit 
the typical chronic schizophrenia. The patient with refractory 
psychosis is particularly difficult to treat. These patients have 
invariably failed trials of several neuroleptics. Their treatments 
of necessity go beyond FDA approved indications and are still being 
researched.
</P>

<P>
A specific <B>treatment approach</B> is outlined in my book 
<A HREF="http://www.pni.org/books/">
Innovative Psychopharmacotherapy</A>.
</P>

<P>
Three pharmacological principles to an approach to the 
non-responsive psychotic, namely toleration, responsiveness 
and pharmacologic tracing are useful. Non-toleration of 
neuroleptics implies that a "functional psychosis" cannot be 
present - organic pathology invariably is.  Thus, review of 
diagnosis and exclusion of organicity is critical. Toleration 
without response may imply non-compliance. If the patient is 
complying, certain fundamental symptoms should be sought 
and adjunctive treatment to neuroleptics considered.  
Pharmacologic tracing is reflected by responsiveness to 
target symptoms.
</P>

<P>This leads to the following <B>plan</B>:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    First ensure compliance, if necessary with short-acting 
    intramuscular injection or with depot neuroleptics.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Second, evaluate toleration of antipsychotic doses on the 
    basis of extrapyramidal, hypnogenic, and autonomic 
    side-effects. Non-toleration implies organic disease, often 
    hyperthyroidism.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Third, test the limits of appropriate neuroleptic: low doses 
    in some instances are suitable, high doses in others particularly 
    chronic hallucinosis. Dosage of neuroleptic is critical: while 
    the continued presence of florid symptoms without side-effects 
    implies increasing doses, neuroleptic overdosage is a common error.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Fourth, recognize that not all neuroleptics are equal. Choice of 
    neuroleptic is very important: their different receptor 
    profiles allow specific guidelines for management. Each drug has 
    special effects at several different receptors. Clozapine is 
    especially topical and difficult to use. Two special options 
    are the use of sulpiride in the presence of refractory positive 
    psychotic features, and of pipothiazine palmitate when deficit 
    features predominate, are often worth considering.
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
<B>Risperidone</B> with its profound serotonin 2 blockade and 
potent dopamine 2 blocking effects is already proving an exciting, 
major breakthrough. Management of target symptomatology such as 
florid psychosis and overmedication is in the context of 
neuroleptic manipulation.
</P>

<P>
The major approach, however, is to seek out <B>target features</B>. 
Add medication usually as adjunct to neuroleptic to treat these 
target elements.
</P>

<P>
Management of target symptomatology such as anxiety, 
extra-pyramidal features, affective components, hostility, tardive 
syndromes involves appropriate non-neuroleptic adjuncts.
Frequently such innovative therapies are given as adjuncts 
to neuroleptics because they control specific symptoms not 
psychotic features. Propranolol, Buspirone and Carbamazepine are 
neglected forms of such innovative therapy and also useful are 
Lithium, Antidepressants, Dopamine agonists and Dietary / 
Pharmacologic environmental manipulations.
</P>

<P>
In the evaluation of non-responsive psychosis, there are several 
<B>fundamental key symptoms</B> that should be sought namely anxiety, 
hostility, manic irritability, labile mood, extrapyramidal features, 
tardive symptoms, depression and nutritional status, diet, use of 
alcohol, caffeine  and smoking. These lead to different approaches. 
The following are highlighted:
</P>

<P>
The first fundamental symptom to be sought is <B>anxiety</B>. 
Tachycardia is an important feature in the non-responsive psychotic, 
many of whom still seem to have a substantial degree of anxiety, 
even after eliminating such obvious causes as thyrotoxicosis.
</P>

<P>
Most of the literature on <B>benzodiazepines</B> indicate that 
they do not apparently relieve anxiety in the psychotic, except 
in rare instances in very high doses. Benzodiazepines can, however, 
be used in mania, catatonia, for nonspecific sedation and in 
epileptics.

<P>
On the other hand, there is a substantial body of research 
claiming that d1-<B>propranolol</B>, a beta-adrenergic receptor 
blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and a 
substantial degree of lipid solubility, may in fact have 
antipsychotic-like actions. This anti-psychotic activity of
propranolol is not established either empirically or on theoretical 
grounds.  On theoretical grounds, it does not have any dopamine 
antagonism effect and does not therefore cause any kind of 
hyperprolactinaemia or growth hormone alteration.
</P>

<P>
<B>Carbamazepine</B> may be useful in hostility, lability, 
temporal lobe pathology and previous hallucinogen usage. The 
iminostilbene, carbamazepine, (CBZ) (Tegretol), is most commonly 
used as an anticonvulsant and is equally efficacious to 
phenytoin in the control of tonic-clonic seizures and is 
frequently used in complex partial seizures and atypical absences, 
and for trigeminal neuralgia. Side effects with regard to mental 
status are far less than with anticonvulsants such as phenytoin 
and phenobarbital.
</P>

<P>
CBZ is being increasingly used in the treatment of non-epileptic 
psychiatric patients although not marketed as such.  The improvements 
in CBZ have consequently been interpreted as psychotropic actions.  
These may be a property of its special anti-convulsant profile or 
distinct from it. CBZ is also the prime limbic antikindling agent 
in experimental animals. The efficacy of CBZ in psychiatric illness 
is attested by increasing literature arising from Japanese, American 
and European research, inter alia, of its use in affective 
illness. There is a growing but still limited evidence for its 
usefulness in both the prophylaxis and treatment of affective illness 
and in non-responsive psychosis. Some uncontrolled evidence suggests 
carbamazepine's efficacy may be particularly marked in those 
patients who have had affective illness for periods of many years 
as opposed to new patients.  Carbamazepine is today probably most 
often used in the rapid cycling patient in which fluctuations of 
mood have at times been noted over a matter of hours and days.  
In contrast, it has also been used only occasionally in 
schizo-affective illness and there are supporting double-blind s
tudies  However, preliminarily responses may have related to the 
affective features.  A broad use of the drug is suggested by this, 
and it is probable that its mode of action is different from lithium.  
Lithium-responsive and carbamazepine-responsive affective illness 
may ultimately represent several separate conditions.
</P>

<P>
The use of carbamazepine has been extended beyond mood disorder 
to the non-responsive psychotic.  This has been a consequence of the 
hypothesized control of limbic instability by carbamazepine, implying 
that it may have effects on schizophreniform illness associated with 
temporal lobe dysfunction, or effects on dyscontrol, or on 
temporo-limbic instability linked to the non-responsive psychotic. 
The only double blind study is Neppe's crossover study in South Africa 
of carbamazepine in the non-epileptic, non-responsive psychotic 
admitted on the basis of an electroencephalographic temporal lobe 
abnormality (the target feature) and chronic non-responsive 
psychosis using 200 mg three times a day. Statistically significant 
improvements occurred on all three measuring instruments. Most 
interesting was the specific improvement noted at an interpersonal 
level. The patients reported being far more in control of themselves. 
They felt far less hostile or aggressive. Serum levels of carbamazepine 
suggest a low therapeutic range for seizures, namely, four to ten 
mg/l, and this still is the only such study with information on serum 
levels. No other double-blind studies of CBZ in hostility exist and 
anger ultimately appeared to be an important consistent factor which 
improved.  Subsequent to the original Neppe study, numerous other 
investigators have found that hostility diminishes considerably. 
Consequently, carbamazepine's relevance to non-responsive psychosis 
may be particularly important in controlling hostility.
</P>

<P>
No benefit of carbamazepine on a relatively classical chronic 
schizophrenic population occurs. Indeed, possibly due to the 
pharmacokinetic decrease of neuroleptic levels, the schizophrenic 
patients, in fact, at times deteriorated.  Carbamazepine possibly 
may be valuable in a specific subgroup of violent patients.
</P>

<P>
Carbamazepine adjunctive innovative therapy should be considered 
in non-responsive psychotics with difficulties in self-control, 
previous histories of drug use of hallucinogens and in patients 
in whom a kindling-like process could have occurred.
</P>

<P>
Other anticonvulsants such as phenytoin may at times have roles.
</P>


<P>
Another group of accessory symptoms to analyze relates to the 
presence of an affective component, often labelled "schizo-affective 
illness": patients in this category do not have the affective 
blunting of schizophrenia nor do they have the exaggeration of 
mood that would suggest affective illness, per se. In these patients, 
lithium carbonate or other lithium preparations are logical attempts 
at innovative therapy.
</P>

<P>
<B>Lithium</B> may aggravate schizo-affective illness when 
used with neuroleptics, increasing the risk of side effects, 
but in other instances, improvements have been reported.  
Psychomotor acceleration,  episodes of acuity, and pathological 
excitement have been hypothesized to be more responsive to lithium.  
There appears no adequate way, at present, to differentiate these 
two opposing results. The mechanism of effect of lithium manic 
psychosis is as yet unknown and until this is clarified its use in 
non-affective illness becomes a shot in the dark. Establishing an 
underlying biochemical framework for a drug is necessary.
</P>

<P>
In the non-responsive psychotic with affective features, 
alternatives exist. Co-existent depression can be handled with an 
<B>appropriate antidepressant</B>, particularly when patients 
exhibit symptoms of clinical depression other than anergia. The 
heterocyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor groups of 
antidepressants can induce improvement, deterioration or no 
real change in condition. At this point only clinical judgment can 
be exercised as to specific drug choice as there are no special 
target features.
</P>

<P>
Another key symptom to be sought in the non-responsive psychotic 
is extra-pyramidal features. These must be adequately treated. 
The psychotic patient with even the mildest degree of 
extra-pyramidal feature may manifest not necessarily as rigidity, 
tremor or akinesia but as very mild akathisia, some degree of 
listlessness, or a complaint of mild stiffness. The nonresponsive 
relevance is a dynamic one: Such symptoms and signs may be 
interpreted by the psychotic that an external agency is controlling 
his thinking, affecting his motoric behavior and his impulses.  
This sequence can exacerbate the psychotic condition.  Modification 
of such features using <B>anticholinergic agents</B> may induce 
substantial psychodynamic change in the patient: his delusional 
external agency is no longer controlling him and he may be able 
to improve. However, anticholinergics have major disadvantages. 
A reduction in dosage or a shift to a more appropriate neuroleptic 
may be a more appropriate method of management.
</P>

<P>
One other aspect of innovative therapy of the withdrawn 
non-responsive psychotic is controversial: In the absence of 
response to dopamine antagonists, add dopamine agonists such as 
the various forms of <B>levodopa</B> (combined for example with 
bensarimide or carbidopa to prevent the peripheral dopamine agonist 
effects).  There is a literature on the use of levodopa in schizophrenia, 
and it is interesting that the author has recently described a 
series of patients with catatonic stupor, who did not respond to 
neuroleptics, but improved from a catatonic state with levodopa. 
Following this, they became floridly psychotic and required 
neuroleptics in a then-uneventful recovery.  The use of levodopa is 
innovative therapy at its most extreme and speculative.
</P>

<H2>Drug Interactions</H2>

<P>
The use of combination psychotropic and other drugs is extremely 
common.  Often the potential for <B>pharmacokinetic</B> interactions 
is neglected. This is particularly so, as almost all are 
psychotropic agents act other than the beta-adrenergic blocking 
agents act directly at brain level and are lipid soluble.  This 
in turn implies that they need hepatic drug biotransformation. 
This generally involves a particular cytochrome, the P-450 cytochrome 
enzyme system in the liver. The situation is complex indeed.  At 
times, the theoretical hypotheses do not stand up in practice and 
studies do not demonstrate marked interaction.  It is probable 
that degree of psychotropic interactions varies widely among 
individuals and is partly genetically determined.  Besides 
hepatic biotransformation, clearly medications may interfere with 
absorption of the drug.  Drugs should be administered at the same 
time and under similar circumstances each day, for example, with 
meals. This may have the advantage of diminishing side effects.  
Alternatively, there may be changes in degree of absorption. 
Similarly, agents such as antacids and as noted later common 
beverages such as coffee may substantially effect absorption from 
the gut.
</P>

<P>
In addition to the pharmacokinetic interactions, predominantly at 
the hepatic level, and any limitation pertaining to renal excretion 
of drugs, a second major consideration when giving drugs in 
combination is a <B>pharmacodynamic</B> effect.  This implies that 
the new drug is having specific actions in the psychiatric context 
at the levels of modification of behavior or psychological functions. 
The drug is therefore demonstrating its psychoactive functions, and 
these psychoactive functions may be modulated directly at 
neurotransmitter levels or indirectly by modifying complex or basic 
biochemical cycles. The addition of one drug to a regimen does not 
necessarily imply that its effects on neurotransmitters and 
hormonal or biochemical cycles will be exactly the same as if that 
drug were given alone. Clearly this is not so, as for example 
particular receptors may already be blockaded. Consequently, side 
effects of unexpected kind may occur. A useful principle, therefore, 
is to prescribe one drug at a time.  If the second drug is added, 
it should be added during a period when the side effects and 
therapeutic effects of the interaction of the combination regimen 
can easily be evaluated. Two drugs should not initially be 
prescribed together, because their individual effects will be more 
difficult to evaluate. Similarly, not only should one drug change 
be made at a time, but only single dosage changes should be made 
at any one time, again allowing better quantification of side 
effects.  In similar fashion, the effects of a drug initially may 
not be the same as the effects of that drug at a later point, 
due to changes at kinetic, dynamic and psychological levels.
</P>

<P>
The role of diet, cigarette smoking, caffeine, and alcohol in 
affecting these parameters is very significant and should 
always be considered. Cigarette smoke can induce the P448 and 
P450 cytochrome systems and alcohol chronically induces and 
acutely competes at the P450 level.  Nicotine in cigarettes has 
its own added pharmacology as does the stimulant caffeine. Finally, 
diet may effect absorption, diurnal rhythms, metabolism and have 
potential pharmacodynamic and neurotransmitter effects - for 
example, tryptophan as a serotonin precursor induces sleep.
</P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
A substantial proportion of patients previously regarded as 
non-responsive will respond using one or at times a combination 
of the above psychopharmacological techniques with appropriate 
psychotherapeutic and environmental interventions.
