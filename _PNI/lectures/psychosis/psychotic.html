<H1>Management of the Refractory Psychotic</H1>

<P>Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD</P>

<H2>Educational Objectives</H2>

<OL>
  <LI>
    To educate in the area of refractory, atypical and nonresponsive 
    psychosis, particularly the clinical psychopharmacologic management.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To create a workable outline with regard to management options 
    and problems.

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The patient with refractory psychosis is particularly difficult to treat. 
These patients have invariably failed trials of several neuroleptics. 
Their treatments of necessity go beyond FDA approved indications and 
are still being researched.
</P>

<P>
A specific treatment approach is outlined in my book 
<A HREF="http://www.pni.org/books/">
Innovative Psychopharmacotherapy</A>.
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    First ensure compliance, if necessary with short-acting 
    intramuscular injection or with depot neuroleptics.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Second, evaluate toleration of antipsychotic doses on the basis 
    of extrapyramidal, hypnogenic, and autonomic side-effects. 
    Non-toleration implies organic disease, often hyperthyroidism.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Third, test the limits of appropriate neuroleptic: low doses in some 
    instances are suitable, high doses in others particularly chronic 
    hallucinosis.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Fourth, recognize that not all neuroleptics are equal. Clozapine 
    is especially topical and difficult to use. Unmarketed drugs such 
    as sulpiride and pipothiazine are especially interesting. Each drug 
    has special effects at several different receptors.
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
The major approach, however, is to seek out target features. Add 
medication usually as adjunct to neuroleptic to treat these target 
elements.
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    Carbamazepine may be useful in hostility, lability, temporal 
    lobe pathology and previous hallucinogens. Other anticonvulsants 
    may at times have roles.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Lithium and antidepressants have applications in affectively 
    linked conditions.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Anticholinergics have special roles in possible akathisia and 
    extrapyramidal side-effects.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Propranolol and other beta 2 active drugs such as nadolol have roles 
    in significant anxiety.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Benzodiazepines can be used in mania, catatonia, for nonspecific 
    sedation and in epileptics.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Nutrition elements are important as is the special role of 
    caffeine, cigarettes and drugs of abuse.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Levodopa is particularly interesting in the catatonic patient 
    and has special implications for dopamine research.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Buspirone may have a special role in tardive dyskinesia, tardive 
    psychosis, possible tardive prophylaxis, irritability and 
    obsessionality. The doses may be critical. There may be a link of 
    serotonin 1A and dopamine.
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Using this framework, a fascinating and apparently successful 
intervention plan can be developed.
