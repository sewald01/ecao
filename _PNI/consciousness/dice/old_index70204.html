<H1>Introduction to Dice Game</H1>

<P>
The Dice Game is a simple experiment to test your ability to predict
the next throw of the die. Given that this is randomly distributed, it
could be argued that if you score significantly outside the normal range
you would be testing your abilities of anomalous experience.
However, there may be alternative explanations such as the degree of
random distribution and statistical probabilities of scoring against
chance as well as erroneous problems within the program or hacking or
physical peeking (this the program tries to prevent). By these means we
try to illustrate the limitations and strengths of such statistical
testing.
</P>

<P>
We may also be collecting data, for example: Are some people better at
visualizing the actual die faces compared with digits? Are geographic or
time variations important? Do people with some characteristics do better
than others?  These data may be used for research or publication; playing
the Dice Game signifies tacit consent to use of these data.
</P>

<P>
You will be asked to guess the roll of a die. A typical person will
guess the correct roll one out of six times, however, a usual
distribution for this given say 20 rolls would be 3 to 7. If you score
higher than that - for example 9 or 10 or very low say 0 or 1, you will
have the option of being contacted for further research, where we will
request your permission to pass your name onto other researchers.
<!--
If you in any event want to answer our 
<A HREF="">paranormal type screen questionnaire, please click here.</A> 
This does not mean you need to have
had such experiences: it is just as important for this research to have
so-called "control" groups.
-->
 It you fill in this questionnaire you will be automatically assigned a
special code which will fill in when you take the dice game (you can also
make a note of it and fill it in every time you subsequently play the dice
game). </P>

<P> Note that you must use a Netscape Cookies compatible browser for the
Dice Game.  For example, Netscape 3.0 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.
</P>

<P>Also, playing signifies tacit consent to our use of that data. Use
constitutes agreement with the <A HREF="/disclaimer.html">disclaimer</A>.</P>
