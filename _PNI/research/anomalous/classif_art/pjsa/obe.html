<P>The following article has been reprinted from the PJSA. It is old
and although checked for accuracy (using spelling in British English!) it  
is possible that reference numbers or other typographical errors have
arisen. Nevertheless, as this paper reflects the pioneering work in the
area of subjective anomalous experience in relation to clinical
psychiatric frameworks, it may be of enormous importance to
phenomenologists and researchers and it is reprinted here for academics.

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>This editorial comment evaluates the new phenomenological
classification of anomalous experience - Neppe's Anomalous Multiaxial
Evaluation Schemaa I (NAMES I) in the context of Irwin's phenomenological
analyses of the out-of-body experience.  These suggest a revision of NAMES
(NAMES II).  Axis C becomes Content.  Correspondences are included under
Axis J - Judgment, special characteristics, context, and environment under
Axis G - Gestalt and demography and prior knowledge should always be
considered as adjuncts.</P>

<P>Brief reviews of detailed theoretical treatises which cover numerous
different areas are necessarily selectively personal: I was particularly
pleased with Irwin’s major attempts at classifying the out-of-body
experience (OBE) in his book <CITE>Flight of Mind: A Psychological Study
of the Out-of-Body Experience</CITE>.  Irwin's 
phenomenological / classificatory attempt is spread over many chapters. 
This paper attempts to integrate it into my own recently published
multiaxial classification of anomalous events<A
HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.</P>

<P>OBEs can be categorized at numerous different levels:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    Celia Green conceived of parasomatic and asomatic OBEs. 
    In the former there is the subjective impression of exteriorisation 
    of consciousness at a spatial level, in the latter this is not 
    so. Irwin points out a third possibility:  consciousness exteriorised 
    from both the physical and parasomatc (astral body). This group, 
    unnamed by Irwin, could be called aparasomatic Green’s classification 
    therefore emphasizes <I>form</I>.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Robert Crookall categorized the OBE on the basis of its broad 
    circumstances of induction - enforced or natural.  Enforced 
    OBEs are precipitated by intoxication, anaesthesia, trauma, 
    hypnosis and other special triggers. This contrasts with the 
    natural OBE reflecting a more gradually developing or chronic 
    condition - sleep, exhaustion, illness, near death experiences, 
    relaxation, meditation and purely spontaneous events are 
    examples.  Crookall sees the specific precipitators of enforced 
    OBEs as <I>catalyzing agents</I>. The details of induction 
    techniques are also relevant.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Harvey Irwin subdivides the content of the OBE into three: 
    asensory, naturalistic and supernaturalistic.  This broad 
    content categorization seems particularly valuable and, in my 
    opinion, may, in fact, be a worthwhile conceptualization for 
    other delta afferentation phenomena such as the contents of 
    the various kinds of so-called extrasensory perceptions.
  </LI>

<P>Irwin's naturalistic OBE consists of impressions from normal (earthly)
sources (realms) even though they may be from unusual or unfamiliar
environments.  This contrasts with OBEs that subjectively seem to derive
from another plane of existence - the experients may, for example, believe
they have visited "astrally" a spirit realm, paradise or heaven.  These
are supernaturalistic OBEs.  Irwin would classify subjective "visits" to
other planets like Mars as "naturalistic" if the subject's conviction is
that it was natural, not supernatural.  Irwin does consider OBEs with both
naturalistic and supernaturalistic components.  A convenient term. I
suggest for such an experience would be the <I>metanaturalistic</I> OBE. 
Finally Irwin points out that perceptual impressions are often completely
lacking which he calls the asensory OBE.</P>

<P>PJSA 1985, 6:2, 100-110</P>
<P ALIGN="center">102</P>

  <LI>
    Irwin also subdivides "content of the OBE" into primary (common) 
    and secondary (less common) percepts of the exteriorised self. 
    In my opinion, the consistency of the primary pattern 
    may allow easier confirmation that the experience described 
    conforms to laid down criteria for 
    OBEs such as "OBE in the neighborhood of the physical body" 
    and "looking down at one's 
    body"  Amongst the secondary experiences are those that 
    resemble the NDE - the tunnel experience, the supernaturalistic 
    OBE and contact with discarnate entities.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Form leads naturally from content.  Whereas spatial 
    distinctions such as asomatic /parasomatic/aparasomatic can 
    be valuable, Irwin analyses the form of OBE in a 
    manner similar to my own analysis of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, namely:
  </LI>

  <UL>
    <LI>What sensory modalities were involved?</LI>

    <LI>How vivid was the OBE?</LI>

    <LI>How much control did the experient (OBE-er) have over his OBE?</LI>

    <LI>
      How veridical was the OBE based on acquisition of 
      paranormal information?</LI>
    </LI>

    <LI>
      What special arasomatic OBE details exist?  Examples cited are 
      dress, lateral reversals in, density of, motion of and desired 
      passage to other locations of the "astral body".  Also the 
      presence of an "astral cord" and sense of personal identity are 
      pertinent.
    </LI>
  </UL>

  <LI>
    The psychological processes that have occurred are important. 
    How alert is the OBE-er? What emotional state and cognition were 
    concomitant to feeling out of the body?  Did time sense alter?  
    What expectations did the subject have and what were his needs?
  </LI>

  <LI>
    A further subdivision to the OBE is the perceptual 
    concomitants at the onset and termination of the OBE. 
    Irwin cites four types, in isolation or combination:  
    "percussive or other noises" e.g. buzzing or music;  "vibrations 
    of the physical body";  "awareness of severance of body 
    control and feeling"; and a momentary experiential "gap 
    in the stream of consciousness." Termination phenomena include 
    strong emotions like fear, contempt or revulsion; stimuli such 
    as being touched, called or otherwise distracted; and finally 
    deliberate efforts to return.  In my opinion, it is interesting 
    that these experiences may have links to the temporal lobe of the brain.
  </LI>

<P>PJSA 1985, 6:2, 100-110</P>
<P ALIGN="center">103</P>

  <LI>
    Circumstances of the OBE occurrence prior to the OBE 
    have a further "phenomenological" approach.  This analyses 
    antecedent mental processes -cognitive, affective 
    and motivational perspectives to the pre-OBE state. These 
    "short-term factors" may at times reflect "longer-term" constitutional 
    factors.  Antecedent physical states are also vital:  the actual 
    physical location, e.g. home; the meteorological features; 
    the sensory character of the environment, e.g. light-dark and 
    sensory deprivation and bombardment, state of health of the OBE-er
  </LI>

  <LI>
    9. Demographic characteristics of the OBE-er are also relevant: 
    age, sex, marital status, social and educational background, 
    religion and religiosity, race and culture should be available 
    although there is little evidence of any of these playing major 
    roles in the OBE.  Personality factors, if available, should be recorded.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    An important direction for analysis is prior knowledge of 
    the CD the role of socio-cultural conditioning to the OBE. 
    Thus, subjects should be questioned as to whether they have 
    heard or read about the phenomenon.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Neurophysiological bases to the phenomenological experience 
    are also important - electroencephalograms, sleep records, 
    pharmacological studies and specific neurophysiological 
    bases (such as temporal lobe features, epilepsy and migraine) 
    are specific areas to be documented if data is available.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    Finally, the impact of the OBE (its consequences) on the 
    OBE-er should be noted.
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>All these factors can be documented separately in order to categorize
the OBE adequately.  They are here "tried for fit" into NAMES - Neppe's
Anomalous Multiaxial Event System - which appears to be the only
multiaxial classification schema of anomalous experience.  Table IA lists
the features from the OBE perspective, Table IB uses NAMES as the starting
point and examines how Irwin's cited phenomenological characteristics fit,
and Table IC uses Irwin's OBEs as a baseline and applies NAMES to it.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">107</P>

<P>I am surprised at how much of Irwin's data is excluded from NAMES.
Initially, one feels that Neppe's Axes A - J are quite inadequate for
meaningful discussion of the OBE.  The problem is a 10 level multiaxial
classification of an anomalous event imposing special limits: however, key
elements must be included.</P>

<P>Referring to Table IC, what excluded features should be included in
NAMES?</P>

<P>Content perspective and frequency of special contents are obviously
important:  they allow an impression of typicality of the OBE.  They must
be applied to the OBE.  Content perspective can easily be generalized to
other forms of delta-afferentation.  Subtyping of ESP experiences may
ultimately lead to "primary" (common) and "secondary (infrequent)
classifications - I see this as impractical and unnecessary at
present.</P>

<P>Only aspects of Form, namely spatio-temporal components and information
veridicality, are conceptualized in NAMES.  I have used all the Form
components Irwin has extracted for the OBE in my d&eacute;j&agrave; vu
work.  This implies parameters can be more broadly applied<A
HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>.  I believe NAMES should include sensory
modalities, vividness/clarity and level of control of the experience
during the experience.  Parasomatic details are important in the OBE but
cannot easily be applied to other anomalous experiences.  Possibly a
category "special characteristics"  should be added to NAMES.  In the OBE
this would be "parasomatic features".</P>

<P>Psychological variables are basically covered.  At this point it may be
superfluous and unnecessary to incorporate emotionality within NAMES as
affect during an anomalous experience is generally congruous with the
content of the experience.</P>

<P>Features linked to the experient's onset and termination of his
experience (be it OBEs or other) can be very valuable information for the
appreciation of the broader context of anomalous experience.  This can be
extended to any psychological, perceptual or cognitive experience during
the anomalous event.  This was applied very fruitfully in my research on
temporal lobe symptomatology and subjective paranormal experience<A
HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>.  I previously believed such analyses of
symptomatology not to be part of the core of the experience, hence I did
not include them in NAMES.  However, they constitute very valuable basic
data, and would include antecedent mental processes such as cognition,
affect and volition. </P>

<P>PJSA 1985, 6:2, 100-110</P>
<P ALIGN="center">108</P>

<P>Antecedent physical states have been shown to be important in psi
research.  The atmosphere contributes to the degree of psi-conduciveness. 
The problem is what factors to include - at what system of the
biopsychofamiliosociocultural model does one focus?  What location,
meteorological, light-dark, perceptual and thermal factors does one
consider?  For the present, I believe that such conditions must be
described or tabulated in detail when they are perceived as unusual,
anomalous or abnormal.  For example, seances frequently occur in the dark; 
presences are often described with concomitant thermal coldness;  and
Faraday cages constitute a special location.</P>

<P>Demographic features should, of course, be obtained.  However, they are
not fundamental to NAMES and the actual basic description of the anomalous
experience.</P>

<P>Prior knowledge of events and the impact these events make are special
demographic extensions.  They constitute vital information.  For example,
do subjective paranormal experients with some theoretical knowledge of
parapsychology react in the same way as those ignorant of work in the
area?  I used this comparison very fruitfully in my olfactory
hallucinations study<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>. Finally, NAMES is aimed
at description of the subjects' experience in a broad context.  Thus
whereas neurophysiological correlates have proven valuable in research,
there are specific techniques constituting part of a project and far less
basic than the fundamental multiaxial parameters of NAMES.</P>

<P>In summary, how can Irwin's detailed analyses of the OBE contribute to
the overall descriptions of anomalous experiences?  I believe that it
emphasizes the limitations of my original multiaxial classification.  (I
call this NAMES-I). NAMES-II needs to be developed.</P>
