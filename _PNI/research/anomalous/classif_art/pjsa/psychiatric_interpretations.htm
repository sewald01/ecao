<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

<P>Abnormal symptoms in the psychiatric model may be perceived as no subjective experience to the 
parapsychologist.  An attempt to reconcile these poles and guiding principles suggested for 
differentiation of subjective paranormal experience from psychotic hallucinatory, delusional and 
ego-boundary disturbance.  The possible explanatory models of the psychodynamic acid psycho-
organic schools are then examined. A shift of perspectives at the content-form and 
biopsychosociocultural level is suggested.
</P>

<P>Phenomena, a are generally perceived from within the framework of  one’s training.  A person 
who describes waking up and finding himself outside body such that he ‘could see his physical 
body’ and could not move it would be described by the parapsychologist as having had 'an out-of-
body experience’.  The psychiatrist may record the experience as extreme ego-splitting with sleep 
paralysis'.  Both these specialists cave described a single experience within the perspective of their 
discipline.  From the parapsychological standpoint, frequent 'out-of-body experiences  would be 
described as normal; the psychiatrist may delve deeper into frequent episodes of 'extreme ego-
splitting with sleep paralysis':  he will generally regard this as a ‘symptom' of underlying 
abnormality.  There appears to be a need to reconcile these poles.
</P>

<P>This paper is concerned with phenomena generally classified as ‘psychic’ ('psi', 'paranormal').  
It is not concerned with whether such experiences are objectively paranormal or not.  It analyses 
only the phenomenological facets of such experience.  These are essentially subjective.  
Examination of such 'subjective paranormal experience' (SPE)' can allow psychiatric

<P>interpretation of SPEs.  This appears to prejudice the issue as the-psychiatrist is labelling such 
phenomena along a psychopathological continuum.
</P>

<P>Psychiatric understanding of SPE is base on the medical model.  This perceives subjective 
experience as 'symptoms', and phenomena which one elicits via examination of the patient/subject 
as 'signs'.  Because the majority of SPEs are perceptual in nature, these would be symptoms 
Those SPEs which involve objective change in objects or events (i.e. the psychokinetic groups of 
experiences) may theoretically allow the eliciting of positive physical signs because environmental 
change would have occurred.  In practice, information obtained is almost always retrospective 
and, even ostensible psychokinetic phenomena would be elicited via taking and thus could 
technically be regarded as a symptom. This paper deals exclusively with the perceptual facets of 
SPE ( i.e. subjective paranormal perception); it does not discuss the motoric aspects of SPE  ( i.e. 
alleged psychokinesis).
</P>

<P>Although a fair amount of literature deals with psi psychopathology, particularly the writings of 
Ehrenwald, Ullman, and Eisenbud, there is very little literature discussing specifically the 
psychiatric interpretation of subjective paranormal experience.  One useful perspective, however, 
is
Reed’s excellent treatise on ‘Anomalous Experience’.  This book outlines the cognitive 
psychological explanations of several kinds of claimed 'psychic' experiences. Although there are 
certain psychiatric guiding principles to this problem psychiatry itself is not a discipline which 
allows unanimous consensus in either eliciting or interpreting such 'Symptoms'.  The major
psychiatric principles which require no elaboration are the  concepts of ‘hallucinations’, 
‘delusions’, and 'disturbed ego-boundaries'.
</P>

<P>A hallucination is a false sensory perception occurring in the absence of any relevant stimulation 
of the sensory modality involved 8, p3330. Hallucinations may involve any perceptual type - 
auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, kinesthetic, somatic, vestibular or tactile; occasionally they 
even be synaesthetic - where one modality is perceived as another (e.g. hearing a colour). 
Hallucinations are generally regarded as 'abnormal' by psychiatrists except when they occur during 
certain physiological altered 
</P>

<P>Neppe, V.M.</P>

<P>states of consciousness e.g. just prior to sleep (i.e. hypnagogic) and while waking from sleep
(i.e. hypnopompic).</P>

<P>Generally, hallucinations are regarded as regarded psychotic conditions - in these cases they occur 
spontaneously;  they are often frequent, or are of long duration;  they are complex in character 
involving content;  they involve the whole personality and refer to the percipient himself;  they 
have cognitive or emotional significance;  their content can frequently be interpreted within the 
context of the experient's needs or fears;  they occur suddenly, are fully formed and clear;  they 
involve a conviction as to their being outside the person's own space (i.e. they are external and 
objective), and they are regarded as concrete reality'.  Usually they are not under voluntary 
control.  Thus hallucinations in the psychotic have a special form.</P>

<P>Hallucinations, however, have been described in a significant proportion of ostesibly normal 
people.  Two British surveys, fifty years apart, the first very large (Sidgwick and Committee in 
1894 involving 17000 not quite randomly. chosen subject 5) and the second smaller but still 
substantial (West's one in 1943 involving 1519 subjects) yielded a population life-time incidence 
of 9.9% and l4.3% respectively.  Sidgwick's study, although limited methodologically by today's 
standards, found that the number of unexpected death coincidences involving hallucinations 
exceeded chance probability by a factor of 440.  Because of this, parapsychological hypotheses 
have been suggested.</P>

<P>Hallucinations are common forms of SPEs.  They may particularly involve extrasensory 
perception (ESP) occurring while awake, and the perception of ‘presences', of which 'apparitional 
experiences' constitute presences of well-developed visual kind.
Hallucinations occur as a detailed form of waking ESP when a paragnost to see or hear or 
otherwise experience perceptions from outside himself which relate to events in the past, present 
or future.  He may interpret such a spontaneous phenomenon as 'paranormal' if it were unusual 
and of a non-inferential character, and if it had a close temporal manifest and meaningful 
relationship to, the actual event .  Thus, a dichotomy, exists pertaining to hallucinations in the 
parapsychological-psychiatric psychiatric context.  The two poles of criteria listed may, 
theoretically, easily differentiate such subjective experiences.</P>

</P>Parapsychological...J. of S.A.  J. of S.A. 1982, 3:1, 6-i6.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">9</P>

<P>The problem of interpretation would arise when a paragnost has a hallucinatory experience which 
post hoc, turns out to have only dubious or no meaningful relationship to real events.  Such 
phenomena would best be interpreted in the context of the whole clinical picture -  as reflected by 
both history-taking and examination, and examination; particularly of the mental status.  
Hallucinatory experience influencing or referring to the percipient himself and intruding into his 
personality such that his functionality is impaired, must be perceived to a high functioning person 
who has had numerous SPEs some of which he has validated.</P>

<P>Experiences in which ‘apparitions’ are allegedly seen, or the ‘presence’ of an unseen being has 
been alleged are hallucinatory in that there is no relevant external stimulus to induce such a 
perception.  They appear to occur to 'normal' people, particularly in the elderly:  thus Neppe
found that 59.6% of his 57 generally 40-70 year old subjects had perceived ‘presences’ 14% 
frequently; and Heraldsson’s Icelandic survey showed that 31% of his population (N-902) had 
experiences of apparitions of the dead and the living.</P>

<P>The psychiatric interpretation of ‘presences’ usually relates to an increased level of suggestibility 
which fulfills a need within the generally depressed elderly, widowed percipient.  The sense of 
‘presence’ is culturally perpetuated by the legend of such occurrences, is predisposed to by fatigue 
and loneliness, and pertains to an apparent cognitive set of impressions resulting from above7.  
The experience may not necessarily be hallucinatory instead, it may invoice an illusion - in this 
instance, there is a special perceptual stimulus (such as a curtain moving in the dark)
which is misinterpreted.  It is highly probable that the hallucination-illusion explanation of the 
'sense of presence' is the most suitable one for the majority city of such experiences.  However, it 
is more difficult to explain cases of collective apparitions (40% according to Tyrell) - and some of 
the detailed cases described by Tyrrell13, and later by Green and MacCreery.</P>

<P>In contrast to the hallucination, is the 'pseudohallucination':  is this an unprovoked perception is 
experienced within the percipients' inner space (i.e. in his head), it is subjective, does not appear 
to be part of the external reality and is non-substantial.  The 'pseudohallucination' is probably the 
most common kind of psychiatric equivalent to the </P>

<P>Neppe, V.M.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">10</P>

<P>
ESP ‘feeling’ or ‘impression' or the paragnost suddenly  and often spontaneously obtains an 
impression inside his head of an event which turns out to be contemporaneous (i.e. in the 
present.), precognitive (i.e. in the future) or rarely retrocognitive (i.e. in the past).  This is usually 
auditory or visual, but is sometimes just described as 'meaningful', not involving specific 
modalities.</P>

<P>Frequently, such an 'impression' has a great deal of conviction.  It is usually fragmentary and it is 
often coloured by the conscious or unconscious images, memories or emotions of the percipient 
7.  As with the hallucination proper, the interpretation of such a pseudohallucination should be in 
holistic context.<P>

<P>An 'impression' or 'feeling' nay become strongly fixed in the experients belief system.  It may
become a belief, the truth of which is firmly held, despite others regarding such a belief as patently 
untrue or extremely unlikely.  The experient may, further, not regard such an impression as 
illogical.  In this instance, the 'impression’ may apparently fulfill qualities of a delusion.  To other 
members of his culture it would regarded as a 'false’, fixed belief that is held against objective and 
obvious contradictory proof to the contrary.</P>

<P>Delusional thinking is a hallmark of psychosis, as its content indicates the experient is cut of touch 
with reality.  In the context of the paragnost, his hallucinatory or pseudohallucinatory perception 
may lead to interpretations in which he firmly believes;  alternatively, he may develop a vague 
knowledge (a 'feeling') of some kind of impending event, or about a particular object or person, 
which appears irrational - this may therefore, be a delusional idea; similarly the 'psychic' may 
describe first ‘a sinister,  awry sense of something being different' and this delusional atmosphere  
may lead him onto being 'aware' of certain specific or vague information. 15   Thus, such 
awareness, interpreted as psychic, may alert the experient to certain information on which he 'may 
act.  The situation may be further complicated by the 'psychic' believing' that outside agencies 
such as dead spirits or a higher power are guiding him.<P>

<P>The fixed ideas of the ‘psychic’ may therefore appear delusional to the psychiatrist.  Alternatively, 
the latter may argue that such beliefs,</P>

<P>Parapsychological.   J. of S.A. 1982, 3:1, 6-16<P>

<P ALIGN="center">11</P>

<P>although aberrant within the larger culture, are not deviant within the spiritualistic or other cult  
micro-culture to which the 'psychic' may belong.  This micro-culture may consequently validate 
the paragnost’s beliefs which may therefore be functional and meaningful.  The situation is even
more complicated, however: Rogo stresses how psychotics may be drawn into the psychic 
community and have their delusions reinforced16. On the other hand a normal functioning 
'psychic' who is not a member of any cult micro-culture may have belief systems which contradict 
his wider culture: would this imply he is psychotic?  Nor can  post hoc events be interpreted as 
necessarily assisting.  Thus, if the psychic’s 'delusion' comes true, doctors
cannot by the fact unlabel it to 'non-delusional' :  psychiatrists must base their interpretations on 
the here-and-now, realizing that future objective validation of the ostensibly strange ideas may 
never occur.</P>

<P>In my opinion, a prime differentiator of psychotic from psychic delusions must relate to the degree 
to which the experience interfere with the experients functioning.  The degree of self reference 
and influence these ideas have most probably will parallel the actual degree of psychopathology.  
For
example, a patient presents for the first time with the awareness that she will die that year in 
December and who is able to elaborate numerous previous subjective paranormal experiences will 
most probably become extremely anxious, because of, or concomitant with, her awareness.
Such awareness is in my opinion, delusional irrespective of whether the self-fulfilling  prophecy of 
Dying in December occurs, and irrespective of whether she has influenced her micro-culture to 
accept her awareness. </P>

<P>The third guiding principle in analyzing SPEs psychiatrically is the concept of ‘ego-boundary’ 
disturbance’.  The ‘ego' is that part of ones psychological functioning which mediates between the 
person, his instincts, needs and moral behaviour and the external reality of the real world.  
Intactness of the ego-boundary relates to the ability of the ego to differentiate the real 
from the unreal and to discriminate between self and not-self.
</P>

<P>Ego-boundaries are characteristically greatly disturbed in schizophrenia. In schizophrenia, the 
patient has a disorder in which his thoughts, emotions, drives and instincts may be perceived by 
him as controlled or influenced by external agencies;  the patient may believe his thoughts are not 
private, that they are being extracted from him, or being broadcast.</P>

<P>Neppe, V.M.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">12</P>

<P>or being interfered with or blocked.  Greyson points out how such ego-boundary disturbances 
could be regarded as disturbances of extra-sensory communication and, in fact, how commonly 
schizophrenics believe they have. telepathic abilities (40%  ;  N-20)17.  Such impressions may be 
falsely based as numerous studies of psi abilities in psychotics have indicated that the incidence is 
no higher than in the general population using conventional test methods.  However, it is possible 
that the measuring instruments and procedures adopted should have been differently adapted to 
the psychotic; Ullman, in fact, stresses his clinical impression of pre-psychotic being more 
sensitive to ESP than the normal .  It is such a finding that led Greyson to question whether 
telepathy in mental illness was the deluge causing illness or the delusion - a result of illness 17.</P>

<P>A second condition in which the ego-boundaries are grossly disturbed is in hysterical dissociation.  
In dissociative states, there is a sudden temporary alteration in consciousness, identity or motor 
behavior.  The subject may not remember what he has done during this period, and one extreme 
example of dissociation (either hysterical or schizophrenic)  may be the multiple personality.  The 
relevance of such phenomena to the trance state is mediumship is obvious.  Trance mediumship 
can be explained as an altered state of consciousness in which dissociation occurs such that a 
group of unconscious mental processes in the medium may be verbalize  or otherwise expounded, 
and yet is denied by the medium as having its source in his unconscious.  It is easy to see how 
such phenomena ran be attributed: to outside agencies such as discarnate spirits.</P>

<P>The explanation of material deriving from the unconscious in trance. mediumship received a filip 
from the ‘Philip experiments' in Canada1 and similar replications elsewhere25.  In these the sitters 
developed a fictitious 'discarnate' personality.  They found they could communicate with him 
suggesting that the sitter a unconscious was playing a major role.</P>

<P>The idea of ego-splitting can also be conceived as an ego-boundary disturbance.  In this instance 
one may feel detached from one’s -body and outside oneself.  This out of body experience 
psychiatrically be explained as a result of ego-splitting due to a defense against anxiety. Thus basic 
terminology in psychiatry -hallucinations, delusions' and ego-</P>

<P>boundary disturbance - is useful in explaining how subjective paranormal experience can be 
conceived medically.  However, such explanations should be understood in the context of a 
hierarchy of explanatory levels, as conceived elsewhere by the author21 and George Devereux22.  
Table 1).  Only two of these have psychiatric relevance:  the ante-familiar and pseudo' -familiar 
levels.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Ante-familiar explanations of SPE conceive of such experience as being due to explanations which 
are rooted deeply in one’s unconscious mind.  This explains such phenomena as telepathy or 
clairvoyance by means of psycho-dynamics - unconscious motivations influence one's personality 
and behavior: this is misunderstood as telepathic. Some, such as the Jungian school, imply that 
such paranormal phenomena may be possible because a 'collective unconscious' on the other hand, 
the classical psychoanalysts could explain all such phenomena by finding associations with such 
experiences deep in one’s unconscious.  The modern day psychoanalysts, particularly Eisenbud , 
Schwarz23, Servadio24 and Ullman5 have argued that telepathic information intrudes into 
psychoanalytic treatment.  These ideas are strongly supported by Tornatore’s finding (from a 
much larger sample) of ostensibly psi phenomena at certain turning points in psychotherapy in 
47% of  psychiatrists reporting psi in therapeutic Situations.</P>

<P>Using the ante-familiar explanation of psi21, ESP has been attributed to several different 
psychodynamic mechanisms: "defective reality testing, exceptional imagery, regression to 
narcissistic omnipotence or to symbiotic fusion, escape from existential isolation, projection of 
aggressive or sexual impulses, flight from reality and compensation for personal deficiencies, 
unconscious perceptions accompanied by identification and a desire to acquaint forbidden 
knowledge"17. These explanations may co-exist.  The major feature they illustrate is how ESP 
can be regarded as a 'symptom' within a model of abnormal psychology.  Exactly which symptom 
is hypothesized may well depend more on the psychotherapist than on the subjectively telepathic 
experience.</P>

<P>It is particularly in the context of subjectively paranormal dreams that that the psychodynamic 
(ante-familiar) explanation of psi is valuable.  Dreams are perceived as states in which primitive, 
primitive prelogical thinking abounds.  They provide an outlet for a disguised for  of unconscious 
thinking.  The dreamer may, by mistake, easily come to regard his needs, desires, or fears of a 
particular person or event as revealed in a dream as psychic.</P>

<P>Pseudo-familiarity may be regarded as 'the brain abnormality explanation of psi phenomena'; SPE 
phenomena is due to some brain disturbance in the experient.  Under this category,  fall those 
features of functional psychosis such as the hallucination, delusion and ego-boundary disturbance.  
However, pseudo-familiar explanations of SPE also include the numerous range of possible 
explanations for SPE.	For example the author has shown that SPE in some way be related to the 
temporal lobe6.  One method of interpreting these results would be that 'psychics' have 
dysfunction (or even epilepsy) of their temporal lobes and their experiences are based within the 
brain.  Similarly, Ehrenwald pointed out how the distortions of telepathic pictures resemble those 
of parietal lobe damaged patients:  thus, parietal lobe dysfunction would be a possible explanation 
(although in my view the evidence is weak).</P>

<P>Parapsychological. J. of S.A. 1982, 3:1, 6-16</P>

<P ALIGN="center">15</P>

<P>This  article has suggested numerous psychiatric explanations for SPEs implying that it claimed 
psychic experiences are abnormal.  Such a conclusion should be viewed very carefully because of 
the remarkably high incidence of all kinds of if SPE in the general population demonstrated in at 
least six countries.  In my opinion, labeling all such SPEs 'pathological' would result in most of the 
population being regarded as abnormal.  The most fundamental dichotomy appears to be the 
emphasis of parapsychology on content of the experience, and phenomenological psychiatry on 
the form of the SPE. A shift1 of orientation would probably be worthwhile.  So would the 
appreciation of the predominantly biopsychological model of the sick patient in medicine as 
contrasted with the more sociocultural  model of the normal paragnost in parapsychology.
