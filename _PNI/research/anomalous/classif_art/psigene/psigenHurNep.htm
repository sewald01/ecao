<h3>'PSI-GENETICS': AN ORGANIC PERSPECTIVE</h3>
<h4>Hurst and Neppe reply</h4>

<p>We were stimulated by the response of Dr. C.T.K. Chari to our two articles in this journal.2~3 
In particular, we were interested in Chari's intensive pedigree analyses, which did not disclose 
any familial factor. As predicted by Chari, we will be the first to concede that research into 
'psi-genetics' has just begun.</p>

<p>Although the evidence for a genetic factor in paranormal ability derived from our own two 
families is admittedly of a fragmentary and suggest we nature only, encouraging the initiation 
of extensive twin-family studies, we, nevertheless, have the following kind of model in mind, 
extending the argument of Aldous Huxley in his 'Doors of Perception'4 and 'Heaven and Hell's 
to the effect that chemical influence (by Mescaline) on the whole cerebral cortex widens our 
experience to realms which we call paranormal. A localized area of cerebral dysfunction (whether 
chemical, epileptic or due to a space occupying lesion) could conceivably let in this wider 
reality also. This is in keeping with Ehrenwald's concept of flaw-determined psi responses. 
Because of the 'flaw', penetration through the 'Bergsonian filter' can occur.7 This hypothetical 
filter normally prevents psi information from entering awareness. The genetic mechanism may parallel 
cryptogenic epilepsy in which the work and analyses of Metrakos favours an autosomal dominant genetic 
mechanism with special penetrance features.8 However, anomalous temporal lobe functioning without 
epilepsy is very different 9 and the postulated genetic mechanism may also be different.</p>	

<p>Turning to Chari's communication, we start with his transcultural information concerning the 
content of temporal lobe experiences in India as compared with other countries. A parallel from 
our work is in the content of delusions and hallucinations in Black psychotics in the Johannesburg 
area in comparison with Whites. 10 We are grateful for this further transcultural information. 
However, the diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy ?`TLE) is sometimes difficult 11 and frequently 
non-TLE cases are misdiagnosed as TLE: thus, this transcultural information must be interpreted 
with care. This is particularly so, as certain subjective experiences - the content of which is 
modified by the environment - only rarely relate to TLE (e.g. deja vu) and the actual concept of 
TLE is not interpreted homogeneously.</p>

<p>We are in agreement with Chari as to the absence of a genetic factor in hysteria, as crucially 
argued by Eliot Slater in his definitive Maudsley Lecture.13 In this, he summarized his own twin-family 
data as well as those of Ljungberg.</p>

<p>However, Chari's carefully analysed pedigrees are in our view, amenable to the alternative of the 
'no-genetic factor view' espoused by him, of a single recessive autosomal genetic mechanism. This would 
explain the absence of the trait in ascendants, descendants and even those in the collateral line of 
descent, having regard to the small size of human families.</p>

<p>The variability of the age of manifestation o, a genetic trait - at birth as in polydactyly or in 
middle age as in Huntington's Chorea - is well made by Chari. We may add to a later age of manifestation 
category - cryptogenic epilepsy, schizophrenia and manic depressive disorder, along an increasing age scale. 
This minimizes the role of psychogenic factors in inducing these states. But these, it may be correctly 
claimed are abnormal mental states. In the case of musical ability instanced by Chari, however, we are 
dealing with the upper range of a normal ability. Amram Scheinfeld supplies us with substantial pedigree 
evidence of familial musical genius, without his being able to specify the nature of the genetic mechanism 
involved.14 Chari stresses the complexity of this trait and the possible involvement of polygenes, 
pleiotropism and moderator genes. Moreover, it may well be that only one component, such as pitch response, 
is inherited.</p>

                  <p>This last hypothesis strengthens, rather than weakens, by analogy, the likelihood 
                    of a genetically determined paranormal ability. It is stressed 
                    that our original paper 3 looked at people who perceived their 
                    experiences as paranormal (i.e. 'subjective paranormal experiences' 
                    l5 (SPEs)) not at people with objectifiable paranormal experiences 
                    (i.e. ostensible paranormal experiences l6). Moreover, these 
                    SPEs were of a special kind - they co-existed in patients 
                    with temporal lobe dysfunction. The mechanism involved may 
                    not be generalizable to all subjects with SPEs (i.e. Subjective 
                    Paranormal Experiments 17) and the subjects discussed may 
                    represent a minority subgroup. It is more likely, however, 
                    that anomalous temporal lobe functioning co-exists with SPE 
                    as found by Neppe in his controlled trial in e7~t his SubjectiveParanormal 
                    Experients 18.</p>

<p>Let us end on the note of Chari's contention cited earlier that 'psi-genetics has just begun', and plan 
with him the experimental design of twin-family and other studies to answer definitively the question of 
the existence or otherwise of a genetic factor or genetic factors in psi-phenomena.</p>
