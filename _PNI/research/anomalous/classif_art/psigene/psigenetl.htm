                      ABSTRACT<br>
                      The exact heritability of the faculty of subjective paranormal 
                      experience is unknown. The theoretical role of anomalous 
                      temporal lobe functioning in producing the epiphenomenon 
                      of subjective paranormal experience is delineated. This 
                      kind of anatomical substrate is hypothesized as having certain 
                      specific hereditary predispositions. Further, the genetics 
                      of epilepsy, particularly of the temporal lobe, may give 
                      a clue to genetic faculties in subjective paranormal experients, 
                      although the grounds for such a relationship are tenuous. 
                      <br>
                      1. GENETIC STUDIES IN SUBJECTIVE PARANORMAL EXPERIENTS<br>
                      The inheritance of a psi faculty is not yet established. 
                      Studies appear to be very limited: Nash and Buzby found 
                      that monozygotic (i. e. identical) twins had significantly 
                      greater similarity in their ESP scoring levels than dizygotic 
                      twins. 1 This work was replicated by Charlesworth. 2 A classic 
                      study is the comparable evocation of alpha rhythm (apparently 
                      by ESP) in monozygotic twins by Duane and Behrendt. 3 An 
                      early description was that of Fluornoy who described a family 
                      with four generations of 'psychics'. 4<br>
                      Zorab cites numerous cases of 'psychics' who had strong 
                      family histories of ostensible paranormal experiences. 5 
                      The concept of 'psi running in families' does not, of course, 
                      necessarily imply genetic predisposition as learnt environmental 
                      patterns may possibly explain such phenomena. <br>
                      Finally Owen suggests the possibility of either single gene 
                      or polygenic inheritance of a psi faculty. 6 He stresses 
                      that the former may well imply an essentially biochemical 
                      difference. To replicate this state experimentally a random 
                      psychopharmacological search may be necessary. In contrast, 
                      if psi were polygenic a 'delicate balance of many factors' 
                      may allow experimental treatments in combination. He warns 
                      against avoiding false correlations without causal relationships, 
                      stressing the importance of balanced or factorial designs. 
                      6<br>
                      2. SUBJECTIVE PARANORMAL EXPERIENCE<br>
                      If one were dealing with a genetically determined psi faculty, 
                      an anatomico-physiological substrate for such a faculty 
                      would seem logical. Furthermore, because genetic studies 
                      frequently involve studies of several generations, such 
                      a study would, at present, require retrospective analyses. 
                      For preceding generations to prove retrospectively their 
                      genuine psi faculties would frequently be impossible. Because 
                      of this, the use of Neppe's term, subjective paranormal 
                      experience (SPE)7, is convenient. Such a term does not assess 
                      the objective veridicality of claimed psi events. It is, 
                      however, limited to experiences perceived by the subject 
                      as being of paranormal quality. A hierarchy of defined criteria 
                      can be used to differentiate out the quality of each SPE 
                      along a continuum of subjective veridicality, the most advanced 
                      form in this regard being conformity to 'low-score subjective 
                      paranormal experience. '8<br>
                      ANOMALOUS TEMPORAL LOBE FUNCTIONING AND SUBJECTIVE PARANORMAL 
                      EXPERIENCE<br>
                      Neppe embraced the concept of subjective paranormal experience 
                      in his controlled research on the temporal lobe. He utilized 
                      two extreme groups, one of whom, the Subjective Paranormal 
                      Experients, had had at least sixteen 'low-score' SPEs of 
                      at least four different kinds (eg waking ESP, veridical 
                      dreams, trance-mediumship, psychokinesis). In contrast, 
                      the Subjective Paranormal Non-Experient had had no SPEs, 
                      even of 'high-score kind'. 9 After excluding temporal lobe 
                      symptoms occurring with SPEs and despite the small numbers 
                      used, he found that his Subjective Paranormal Experients 
                      had significantly more 'possible temporal lobe symptoms' 
                      (average 3. 3) than a control group (who had no 'possible 
                      temporal lobe symptoms' at all). These subjects were also 
                      studied electroencephalographically but trends only were 
                      noted, possibly because of the small sample size. 10 &deg; 
                      Neppe's research follows on the pioneering uncontrolled 
                      electroencephalographic (EEG) study of Nelson who found 
                      that, with one exception, the EEGs of eleven mediums and 
                      one automatic writer had temporal lobe abnormalities. 11<br>
                      Three factors should be considered prior to interpreting 
                      these results. Firstly, extreme groups were used - trance 
                      mediums by Nelson, 11 and subjects with large numbers of 
                      SPEs by Neppe. 1O This does not imply that people with occasional 
                      SPEs have unusual temporal lobe functioning. Secondly, Owen 
                      warns against equating correlations with causality. 6 In 
                      these instances, an association with the temporal lobe and 
                      SPE may reflect epiphenomena with two entirely different 
                      origins. Finally, SPEs can neither be equated with genuine 
                      veridical psi experience originating outside the brain nor 
                      with non-veridical distortions of temporal lobe origin. 
                      Consequently, the connection of SPEs with the temporal lobe 
                      does not imply endogenous or exogenous origins of such SPEs. 
                      <br>
                      4. ANATOMICAL CORRELATES TO THE CONSIDERATION OF PSI AND 
                      GENETICS<br>
                      Following on the work of Neppe8'9 and Nelson 11 quoted above 
                      it would be logical to analyse results of genetic studies 
                      on the temporal lobe. These appear to be void. However, 
                      much has been written about the genetics of epilepsy, and 
                      as temporal lobe epilepsy is the major way in which the 
                      temporal lobe manifests dysfunction an understanding of 
                      the genetics of epilepsy may be motivated at a general level. 
                      <br>
                      5. GENETIC STUDIES IN EPILEPSY<br>
                      Anomalous temporal lobe firing in Subjective Paranormal 
                      Experients does not imply the presence of disintegrative 
                      features such as temporal lobe epilepsy. In fact, this condition 
                      occurred in only one of Neppe's experients. In view of the 
                      rarity of temporal lobe epilepsy, however, (- 0. 2% of the 
                      general population) this result suggests that the genetics 
                      of epilepsy would be a specific motivation to be considered 
                      in any uncontrolled case descriptions of families with SPEs. 
                      <br>
                      Kallman and Sander reviewed convulsive phenomena throughout 
                      the animal kingdom, their graded character in Man, and their 
                      universal elicitability by stimuli such as electro-convulsive 
                      therapy. l2 The clinical studies of Conrad showing dizygotic 
                      and monozygotic twin concordance rates of 4, 3 and 86, 0 
                      percentl3 and of Lennox and Gibbs where the corresponding 
                      figures based on EEG criteria were 25, 0 and 100, 0 percent, 
                      l4 were compatible with the hypothesis of a single autosomal 
                      dominant genetic mechanism fully penetrant at the EEG level. 
                      Alstrom, however, found figures in first degree relatives 
                      of his sample derived from the Serefimer Clinic in Norway, 
                      not significantly different from figures in the general 
                      population (parents 1, 3 percent, siblings 1, 5 percent 
                      and children 3, 0 percent). l5 However, in 1 percent of 
                      his sample he found pedigrees suggesting single autosomal 
                      genetic mechanisms, mainly dominant. Hurst, Reef and Sachs 
                      considered that the large families in Soweto might provide 
                      clinical material to elucidate the conflict of the findings 
                      of Conrad and Lennox and the Gibbses on the one hand, with 
                      their single autosomal genetic hypothesis, and Alstrom on 
                      the other, who found no evidence of a genetic mechanism 
                      in the vast majority of his cases, and the possibility of 
                      a single-gene mechanism in a very small minority. l6 The 
                      severity of the cases necessitating confinement in a mental 
                      hospital does not explain the difference, as both the Lennox 
                      group and Alstrom worked with general hospital cases, l5 
                      and Conrad with mental hospital cases. l4 In Hurst's study 
                      conducted at the Meadowlands Clinic, Soweto, 13 of the 46 
                      families (i. e. 28, 3 percent) showed pedigrees compatible 
                      with single-gene mechanisms, 9 dominant, 1 irregular dominant 
                      and 3 non specified. l6 These findings were in line with 
                      the view of protagonists of the single dominant hypothesis, 
                      rather than those of Alstrom. Metrakos made a magnificent 
                      synthesis of previous findings and his own comprising 211 
                      probands and 112 controls, in which, after excluding symptomatic 
                      epilepsies and retaining only the centrencephalic, he proposed 
                      a single autosomal dominant genetic mechanism, with the 
                      special feature of high penetrance within the age range 
                      65 to 145 with rapid tailing off of the incidence curve 
                      below and above this range. l7 Further details will be found 
                      in Hurst. l8<br>
                      CRITERIA FOR RESEARCH INTO THIS PROBLEM<br>
                      The authors believe that an index group of Subjective Paranormal 
                      Experients and a demographically similar control group of 
                      Non-Experients should be utilized. Previous research by 
                      Neppe has illustrated the difficulties of categorizing descriptions 
                      of so-called paranormal experiences by other members of 
                      family into the framework of subjective paranormal experience. 
                      l9 Thus personal interviews are as far as possible necessities. 
                      The criteria for SPE could be those laid down by Neppe. 
                      8'9<br>
                      An important kind of exclusion would be phenomena that are 
                      interpreted as subjectively paranormal but in fact are possibly 
                      psychotic. Subjects with histories of SPEs plus major psychiatric 
                      illness would best be excluded from this research. Moreover, 
                      the delineation of what West calls the 'sane hallucination' 
                      (i. e. the perceptual impression of the paragnost psychic, 
                      his hallucinatory SPE) from 'insane hallucinations' should 
                      be borne in mind. 20 West emphasized the stereotyped, vague, 
                      repetitive and usual auditory nature of the pathological 
                      hallucination. Neppe stressed that the temporal lobe symptoms 
                      of subjective paranormal experients were invariably of perceptual 
                      hallucinatory kind but regarded as possibly the prime differentiator, 
                      the non-existence or the only rare occurrence of impressions 
                      pertaining to self. 8 Self-reference as ideas of influence, 
                      or overvalued concepts or special symbolic interpretations 
                      pertaining to self are hallmarks of major psychopathology. 
                      <br>
                      Because the study suggested would involve analyses of temporal 
                      lobe symptoms as a prime method of establishing an anatomico-genetic 
                      correlate, it is necessary to outline 'possible temporal 
                      lobe symptoms' all of which should be perceived in the context 
                      of the 'company they keep' and of non-leading questions. 
                      Neppe lists the following based on a comprehensive literature 
                      survey. 21<br>
                      1. complex visual hallucinations 1inked to other qualities 
                      of perceptions such as voices, emotions or time<br>

                      5. rotation or dysequilibrium feelings linked to other perceptual<br>

                      sensations<br>

                      7. epileptic amnesia<br>

                      15. hallucinations of indescribable modality<br>
                      16. 'fear which comes of itself' linked to other disorders 
                      (hallucinatory<br>
                      or unusual autonomic)<br>
                      17. uncontrolled, unprecipitated, undirected, aggressive 
                      episodes<br>

                      Neppe has devised a special Temporal Lobe Questionnaire 
                      to serve as for research of this kind21 (Appendix A). Questionnaires 
                      pertaining to Subjective Paranormal Experience can be found 
                      elsewhere. 8 (A Brief Paranormal Questionnaire was published 
                      in an earlier issue of this journall9). <br>
                      7. CONCLUSIONS<br>
                      The value of an anatomical approach to the genetics of psi 
                      based on the high correlation of SPEs to temporal lobe symptoms 
                      is undetermined. It certainly appears a worthwhile area 
                      to pursue. <br>
