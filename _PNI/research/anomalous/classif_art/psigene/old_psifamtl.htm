                      ABSTRACT<br>
                      Two families with several members having both subjective 
                      paranormal experiences (SPEs) and evidence of temporal lobe 
                      dysfunction are described. The genetic mechanism of autosomal 
                      dominance adequately fits the inheritance of these features. 
                      The limitations of the conventional approach to investigating 
                      such cases are emphasized. <br>
                      This paper does not use the methods of examination suggested 
                      in the previous article1 as this study preceded these suggestions. 
                      Instead, it discusses two families, the first involving 
                      information from one member, often corroborated by others, 
                      the second investigating several people. It is intended 
                      to illustrate via concrete examples the possible relationship 
                      between SPE, the temporal lobe and family predisposition. 
                      Cases are deliberately brief and non-comprehensive so as 
                      to concentrate on the key issues. <br>
                      Data in the Family J, involving Mrs. J<br>
                      The case of Mrs. J is presented here because she herself 
                      had had numerous SPEs and several experiences of temporal 
                      lobe kind with a confirmatory electroencephalographic temporal 
                      lobe focus and she gives an unvalidated history of SPEs. 
                      <br>
                      Mrs. J was a particularly good observer of her own experiences. 
                      she is scientifically trained (with a Bachelor of Science 
                      degree in 6iology and Philosophy) and she kept a daily record 
                      of her experiences. Both her son and her husband were, moreover, 
                      able to corroborate her descriptions in many cases. <br>
                      Mrs. J described recurring instances, since her schooldays, 
                      of a 'sensation of being enclosed by a shroud which comes 
                      down and surrounds me, excluding my ability to read and 
                      function properly'. <br>
                      Mrs. J has had numerous unexplained perceptual experiences, 
                      many interpreted by her as subjectively paranormal. She 
                      has encountered many kinds of olfactory hallucinations: 
                      <br>
                      1. pleasant, flowery fragrances; <br>
                      2. smells of burning : wood, ether and musk interpreted 
                      by her as unpleasant; <br>
                      3. the most prominent smell of all was that of paraffin 
                      : this was interpreted as neither pleasant nor unpleasant 
                      ('neutral');<br>
                      4. also regarded as 'neutral' were smells of tobacco and 
                      incense. All these smells have occurred transiently and 
                      intermittently. The neutral and unpleasant smells have not 
                      been associated with any strong cognitive or subjective 
                      paranormal experiences. In contrast, the beautiful fragrance' 
                      she has encountered on several occasions was associated 
                      with a 'sense of mystical union'. These olfactory hallucinations 
                      are particularly interesting because of their similarities 
                      to those described by Neppe in Subjective Paranormal Experients. 
                      3<br>
                      Critically assessing the exact circumstances under which 
                      these olfactory experiences occurred, there were potentially 
                      physica1 sources of tobacco petrol, candles, wood and lavender-scented 
                      mementoes. The smell of paraffin was more difficult to explain 
                      because of the smell being described as ubiquitously present 
                      in several different places. <br>
                      Mrs. J has also encountered unexplained voices heard from 
                      outside and from inside her head (i. e. auditory hallucinations 
                      and pseudhallucinations). These voices were interpreted 
                      by her as paranormal, and they never had self-reference 
                      components. <br>
                      She encountered, inter alia, a humming noise like a tuning 
                      fork' which was also heard by her son, a 'click sound like 
                      a moving bed', and the &#8216;sound of a baby crying' also 
                      heard by her son. - After a detailed history, none of these 
                      auditory phenomena appeared to require paranormal explanations. 
                      <br>
                      Visual perceptual phenomena have involved dimming of vision, 
                      seeing a flickering light on curtains, perceiving 'a ball 
                      of fire about the size of a ping pong ball moving to the 
                      next property' and experiencing a sense of 'mystical union, 
                      ecstasy and the coming of a spirit' with a 'golden sunset'. 
                      <br>
                      The presence of these visual phenomena would conventionally 
                      be most easily interpreted as elementary or complex partial 
                      phenomena of occipital or temporal lobe origins. The separate 
                      occurrences of the mystical sunset experience with the mystical 
                      per fumy fragrance suggests that a manic condition should 
                      be excluded: there was no other evidence of this as an explanation. 
                      <br>
                      Mrs. J has also had three purportedly paranormal dreams 
                      and five veridical ostensibly precognitive experiences, 
                      with floating sensations of feeling out of her body although 
                      maintaining consciousness within, her body. She has had 
                      several episodes of apparent recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis 
                      in her home. <br>
                      It is important to note that despite the numerous SPEs which 
                      Mrs. J describes she does not conform to the stringent requirements 
                      for admission to a group of Subjective Paranormal Experients 
                      stipulated by Neppe. <br>
                      The brief general descriptions of the subject&#8217;s perceived 
                      paranormal experiences illustrate the difficulties of distinguishing 
                      what may be interpreted as ostensibly paranormal from possible 
                      temporal lobe symptomatology. It supports the usage of clinical 
                      and electroencephalographic temporal lobe interpretations 
                      as a possible method of approaching SPEs. <br>
                      The EEG of Mrs. J disclosed a left temporal anomaly in the 
                      form of selective slowing of the alpha rhythm in this region, 
                      suggesting a diagnosis of left temporal lobe dysfunction. 
                      Fourier analysis did not disclose any interhemispheric asynchrony. 
                      <br>
                      Mrs. J stated that her family, on her father's side, was 
                      'very strongly psychic'. She considered her father himself 
                      to have been mediumistic, describing one such experience: 
                      &quot;He kept passing a friend when changing shifts at work, 
                      and on commenting that the friend was very quiet, his companions 
                      said: 'Didn't you know he has been dead a week?&quot;' One 
                      paternal aunt was a professional fortune teller. There were 
                      also other mediums on that side of the family. This history, 
                      on one side of the family only, fits in with a dominant 
                      genetic mechanism. <br>
                      No other blood members of the family were available for 
                      personal interviewing pertaining to their SPEs. The interpretation 
                      of the family history of claimed paranormal faculties via 
                      a single member allows the opportunity for misinterpretation 
                      of even their subjective experiences. Consequently, such 
                      interpretation is inadequate. <br>
                      In this respect, differentiation of SPEs from possible temporal 
                      lobe symptoms and from easier physical explanations of so-called 
                      paranormal experiences can be even less adequately performed. 
                      Moreover, the non-availability of family EEG records in 
                      this kind of case, nor of a history of possible temporal 
                      lobe symptoms, diminishes the objectivity of interpretation 
                      considerably. <br>
                      Thus, the case of Mrs. J is here presented to illustrate 
                      the difficulties of involving only one blood member of a 
                      family in interpretations of the familial relationship between 
                      psi and the temporal lobe. The case motivates the converse 
                      approach, namely, analyzing primarily the temporal lobe 
                      features and only secondarily the subjective paranormal 
                      experiences first-hand in not one but several members of 
                      family. <br>
                      A case of this kind, involving a second family, is now briefly 
                      described. <br>
                      The Second Family B<br>
                      In the second family, the index case, Mrs. I, presented 
                      to one of the authors (LAH) for genetic counseling because 
                      of her husband's history of schizophrenia. <br>
                      The mother, M aged 48, the index case, I aged 24, a male 
                      sibling, B aged 26, a female sibling, S aged 22, were all 
                      examined and showed clinical evidence of temporal lobe dysfunction 
                      with subjective paranormal experiences and EEG evidence 
                      of temporal lobe dysfunction. A formal temporal lobe clinical 
                      examination via the TLQ was not performed. <br>
                      Two brothers, B2 (aged 29) and B3 (aged 28) were not examined 
                      for geographical reasons. B2 has denied to I any SPEs, while 
                      B3 has described somnambulistic and floating experiences. 
                      Bumping his big toe withdraws B3 from such feelings, which 
                      is of interest as brother B can influence his symptoms by 
                      rapid movement of the big toe. <br>
                      The 6 year old daughter of B1, 'N', was given an EEG examination 
                      at the request of her father because he was concerned about 
                      possible lapses of memory, which were not borne out by clinical 
                      assessment. Results were equivocal. <br>
                      Some clinical information of the sibship of mother M was 
                      available. The mother and brother U1 (aged 51) experienced 
                      recurrent visual hallucinations and another, U2 (aged 32) 
                      had floating experiences, but her sisters A1 (aged 40) and 
                      A2 (aged 32) reported nothing. <br>
                      The husband of Mrs. M, F, reports no subjective paranormal 
                      experiences and the facts of the grandparental generation 
                      in this regard are unknown. <br>
                      The pedigree is reflected in Figure I (because of its nature 
                      this is not publishable on the internet). <br>
                      The genetic findings are consistent with single autosomal 
                      dominance<br>
                      In the parental generation the father's family is unaffected, 
                      but three out of five siblings are, including the mother, 
                      M. In the filial generation four out of five are affected 
                      (counting B3 who had not been examined clinically or by 
                      EEG). These ratios, in the parental and filial generation 
                      exceed the 1:1 ratio for single dominance but are acceptable 
                      in view of the small size (five per group). Whether daughter 
                      N (aged 6) is affected or not is compatible with single 
                      autosomal dominance. <br>
                      Thus, the clinical and EEG features of temporal lobe dysfunction 
                      in this family have been transmitted in a manner compatible 
                      with single autosomal dominance. <br>
                      The subjective paranormal experiences of this family with 
                      multiple features of temporal lobe dysfunction were also 
                      analysed. <br>
                      The SPEs of the children, 82, B1, 1 and S, could be categorized 
                      into<br>
                      three types:<br>
                      1. Out-of-body experiences - these occurred in three of 
                      the four. <br>
                      2. A 'floating hallucinatory state' - all four described 
                      this &#8211; the feelings of floating occurred hypnagogically 
                      or hypnopompically, and were associated with visual and 
                      auditory hallucinations. 3. Claims of being psychically 
                      gifted - this was made by two of the four. Neither conformed, 
                      however, to stringent criteria for SPEs. 3<br>
                      General Discussion regarding the Ultimate Basis of Experience 
                      in Both Families<br>
                      The autosomal dominant mechanism of SPE and temporal lobe 
                      dysfunction implied in these two families, suggests that 
                      the postulated theoretical relationship between genetics, 
                      psi and the temporal lobe1 may have practical applications. 
                      It also delineates the difficulties in the neuropsychiatric-parapsychological 
                      context of taking conventional family histories from other 
                      members of family, and the problem of differentiating<br>
                      SPEs from possible temporal lobe symptoms. <br>
                      The authors would like to link Gordon Nelson's tentative 
                      hypothesis that temporal lobe dysfunction is a prerequisite 
                      for mediumship, 4 with the contrasting views of Aldous Huxley 
                      in his &quot;Doors of Perception&quot; 5 and &quot;Heaven 
                      and Hell&quot;6 and of Ward in his &quot;A Drug Taker's 
                      Notes&quot;. 7 Nelson's hypothesis may be taken in one of 
                      two senses. To the skeptic, the implication is that the 
                      psychical experiences of mediums are nothing but expressions 
                      of brain pathology and are consequently mere psychopathological 
                      symptoms. If, however, Aldous Huxley's theory that under 
                      mescaline or LSD the 'bread and butter', 'down to earth', 
                      adaptive function of the brain is extended to an awareness 
                      of a wider reality (through a localized area in the case 
                      of temporal lobe dysfunction or the whole brain under mescaline) 
                      then the experiences that filter through may be labeled 
                      ESP. <br>
                      Ward's skeptical, materialist point of view in the sphere 
                      of mescaline and LSD relates to his finding that, with repeated 
                      exposure, the experiences of the subjects become increasingly 
                      trivial. Our own LSD investigation was inconclusive8' 4 
                      and so it must be left to the reader to decide whether the 
                      experiences of these two families, based on temporal lobe 
                      dysfunction, are to be regarded as mere symptoms or as the 
                      opening up of a richer, wider world. <br>
