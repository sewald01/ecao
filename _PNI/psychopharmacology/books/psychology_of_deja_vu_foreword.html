                          of D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu (Professor Lewis Hurst)</H1>
                        <P> It is a privilege indeed to have been asked to write 
                          a foreword to what I regard as one of the major works 
                          of scientific and imaginative genius of our time. Dr. 
                          Vernon Neppe has mobilized, for the understanding of 
                          that fascinating phenomenon on the frontiers of human 
                          experience, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, the resources of 
                          literature, logic, biology, psychology, psychiatry, 
                          and neurology in an incomparable synthesis. He has pursued 
                          his quest relentlessly by an original many-sided research 
                          investigation of impeccable design, issuing in this, 
                          our definitive work in the field. From one perspective, 
                          this research may be seen as the crystallization of 
                          Dr. Neppe`s work in placing Parapsychology on the map 
                          scientifically in South Africa, building on the pioneer 
                          work of Professors Arthur Bleksley, Marius Valkhoff, 
                          and Michael Whiteman. From another angle, the present 
                          book is characterized by rigorous logical thought issuing 
                          in formal definitions, operational definitions, classifications 
                          of both a normal and clinical type in relation to d&eacute;j&agrave; 
                          experience, as well as the most highly sophisticated 
                          differential diagnosis of such entities as temporal 
                          lobe dysfunction, temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia, 
                          that have been found to be associated with a proportion 
                          of Neppe's d&eacute;j&agrave; vu experients. The statistical 
                          analysis of results, although non-parametric owing to 
                          sample size, has nevertheless been conducted in a detailed 
                          and expert manner. But it is not only from the quantitative 
                          aspect that this study excels, but on the qualitative 
                          side also we find a delightful range of personal portrayals 
                          of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu experiences, intriguing and 
                          stimulating to the imagination, from such literary sources 
                          as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Joseph Heller, Charles Dickens, 
                          Marcel Proust and Lafcadio Hearn, as well as from Neppe's 
                          own experimental subjects. The contributions to an understanding 
                          of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and related phenomena from 
                          the full range of disciplines conceivably involved, 
                          (including psychiatry, psychology, neuro-anatomy, neuro-physiology, 
                          neuro-chemistry, general medicine, neurology and pharmacology) 
                          are subtly conceptualized by Neppe, and thereafter exhaustively 
                          explored with the utmost scientific rigor and acumen 
                          before his setting out of his original study - both 
                          on Normal subjects (subjective paranormal non-experients 
                          and experients) and on Neuropsychiatric categories (chiefly 
                          temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia). The clinical 
                          elucidation of this case material is enlivened by apt 
                          and vivid illustrative vignettes. </P>
                        <P> In transforming his doctoral thesis, intended primarily 
                          for specialized medical readers, to this book, for perusal 
                          also by scholars of other disciplines and the general 
                          public comprising intelligent laymen, attracted by a 
                          theme of such universal appeal, Dr. Neppe has gone to 
                          great pains to promote intelligibility through a Glossary 
                          of medical and technical terms, and readability by printing 
                          matters of subordinate allows a unitary detail (e.g., 
                          the foreign terms for variants of d&eacute;j&agrave; 
                          vu) in smaller type. Moreover the statistical analysis 
                          has been compressed, in the knowledge that the original 
                          doctoral work can be consulted for the fuller treatment 
                          of the data. </P>
                        <P> Neppe's main theoretical conclusion of this work merits 
                          quotation in full - 'd&eacute;j&agrave; vu is the epiphenomenon 
                          underlying numerous different phenomenologies. This 
                          would imply that Temporal Lobe Epileptic D&eacute;j&agrave; 
                          Vu is associated with a specific pattern of cerebral 
                          firing, that Schizophrenic D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is 
                          symptomatic of the underlying reality distortion, that 
                          Subjective Paranormal Experience D&eacute;j&agrave; 
                          Vu should be classified as a kind of subjective paranormal 
                          experience with heteropsychic origins and that Associative 
                          D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is due to a redintegrative restricted 
                          paramnesia mechanism, possibly learnt "as an unconscious 
                          reassurance-type ego-defense." </P>

                            book describes the two youngest cases in the literature 
                            and raises the question as to whether 5 is the lowest 
                            age limit for d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, as providing 
                            the cognitive and affective developmental prerequisite.

                        <P> A final synthetic formulation of Neppe's achievement 
                          with its profound theoretical and practical potential 
                          enshrined in this book, is that his classification of 
                          d&eacute;j&agrave; vu experience based on the medical 
                          model, allows a unitary conceptualization of diagnosis, 
                          follow-up and prognosis as well as incidence, pathogenesis, 
                          etiology, clinical features and for the fuller response 
                          to treatment. </P>
                        <P> Dr. Neppe concludes in terms of the imagery of Plato's 
                          Allegory of the Cave, with true philosophical and scientific 
                          humility asking the questions: How many shadows have 
                          been perceived in this research? Has this study just 
                          looked at an epiphenomenon? </P>
