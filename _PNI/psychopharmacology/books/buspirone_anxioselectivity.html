Buspirone (BuSpar) belongs to a new chemical subgroup, previously called
the azaspirodecanediones, now referred to as the azapirones It is the
first in the class of pure anxioselective agents. It differs
substantially in both clinical and pharmacological properties from the
benzodiazepines. Clinically, it does not cause the sedation, hypnosis,
anticonvulsant effects and muscle relaxation effects of the
benzodiazepines, and it takes several weeks to achieve its maximal
therapeutic effects as an anxiety agent. Consequently, target symptoms
such as decreased agitation, irritability, improved concentration, and
diminished worry should be sought after during its first weeks of
administration. Chemically, the exact anxioselective effect probably
relates to a post-synaptic partial agonist effects at the serotonin 1A
receptor at usual therapeutic doses (30-60 mg per day). At higher
supratherapeutic doses it has a partial agonist dopaminergic effect. Its
action initially is as a pure agonist at the autoreceptor raphe nucleus
level; its post-synaptic effect impacts several strategic areas - limbic
system, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and even neuroglia. There
are no significant neuro-endocrine effects of therapeutic doses, and the
drug has no antipsychotic effects. Eleven major research studies,
including nine double-blind studies of buspirone versus diazepam or
chlorazepate, have shown equal efficacy with less untoward side effects
and a marked superiority compared with placebo after four weeks of
treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. This bears out the anxiety
paradigm studies in experimental animals. The anxiolytic action may be
an effect of either the parent drug or its metabolite, 1- 2- pyrimidinyl
piperazine (1PP) or both. Studies in both man and animals suggest
buspirone should not induce physical or psychological dependence, and
drug reactions with other psychotropics are under study. It does not
significantly interact with propranolol, but may slightly raise levels
of haloperidol. It is possible that it could be effective in the
prophylaxis of panic disorder, tardive dyskinesia, in the management of
hostility, and of obsessionality. These are all areas for future
research.
