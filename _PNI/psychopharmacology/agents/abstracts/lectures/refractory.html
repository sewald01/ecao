                        <H2>Educational Objectives</H2>
                        <OL>
                          <LI> To educate in the area of refractory, atypical 
                            and nonresponsive psychosis, particularly the clinical 
                            psychopharmacologic management. </LI>
                          <LI> To create a workable outline with regard to management 
                            options and problems. </LI>
                        </OL>
                        <P> <B>Non-responsive psychosis</B> refers to a chronic 
                          non-neuroleptic responsive psychosis. "Non-responsive 
                          psychosis" is the author's term for patients with a 
                          history of a hallucinatory-delusional condition who 
                          have not returned to their pre-morbid level of functioning 
                          despite adequate neuroleptization for a minimum period 
                          of at least one year. The term is thus non-specific 
                          and descriptive including as a subgroup chronic schizophrenics. 
                          This encompasses far more than typical deteriorating 
                          schizophrenia as many non-responsive psychotics are 
                          not schizophrenic. We should seek out and manage "non-responsive" 
                          psychotics who do not exhibit the typical chronic schizophrenia. 
                          The patient with refractory psychosis is particularly 
                          difficult to treat. These patients have invariably failed 
                          trials of several neuroleptics. Their treatments of 
                          necessity go beyond FDA approved indications and are 
                          still being researched. </P>
                        <P> A specific <B>treatment approach</B> is outlined in 
                          my book <A HREF="http://www.pni.org/books/"> Innovative 
                          Psychopharmacotherapy</A>. </P>
                        <P> Three pharmacological principles to an approach to 
                          the non-responsive psychotic, namely toleration, responsiveness 
                          and pharmacologic tracing are useful. Non-toleration 
                          of neuroleptics implies that a "functional psychosis" 
                          cannot be present - organic pathology invariably is. 
                          Thus, review of diagnosis and exclusion of organicity 
                          is critical. Toleration without response may imply non-compliance. 
                          If the patient is complying, certain fundamental symptoms 
                          should be sought and adjunctive treatment to neuroleptics 
                          considered. Pharmacologic tracing is reflected by responsiveness 
                          to target symptoms. </P>
                        <P>This leads to the following <B>plan</B>:</P>
                        <OL>
                          <LI> First ensure compliance, if necessary with short-acting 
                            intramuscular injection or with depot neuroleptics. 
                          </LI>
                          <LI> Second, evaluate toleration of antipsychotic doses 
                            on the basis of extrapyramidal, hypnogenic, and autonomic 
                            side-effects. Non-toleration implies organic disease, 
                            often hyperthyroidism. </LI>
                          <LI> Third, test the limits of appropriate neuroleptic: 
                            low doses in some instances are suitable, high doses 
                            in others particularly chronic hallucinosis. Dosage 
                            of neuroleptic is critical: while the continued presence 
                            of florid symptoms without side-effects implies increasing 
                            doses, neuroleptic overdosage is a common error. </LI>
                          <LI> Fourth, recognize that not all neuroleptics are 
                            equal. Choice of neuroleptic is very important: their 
                            different receptor profiles allow specific guidelines 
                            for management. Each drug has special effects at several 
                            different receptors. Clozapine is especially topical 
                            and difficult to use. Two special options are the 
                            use of sulpiride in the presence of refractory positive 
                            psychotic features, and of pipothiazine palmitate 
                            when deficit features predominate, are often worth 
                            considering. </LI>
                        </OL>
                        <P> <B>Risperidone</B> with its profound serotonin 2 blockade 
                          and potent dopamine 2 blocking effects is already proving 
                          an exciting, major breakthrough. Management of target 
                          symptomatology such as florid psychosis and overmedication 
                          is in the context of neuroleptic manipulation. </P>
                        <P> The major approach, however, is to seek out <B>target 
                          features</B>. Add medication usually as adjunct to neuroleptic 
                          to treat these target elements. </P>
                        <P> Management of target symptomatology such as anxiety, 
                          extra-pyramidal features, affective components, hostility, 
                          tardive syndromes involves appropriate non-neuroleptic 
                          adjuncts. Frequently such innovative therapies are given 
                          as adjuncts to neuroleptics because they control specific 
                          symptoms not psychotic features. Propranolol, Buspirone 
                          and Carbamazepine are neglected forms of such innovative 
                          therapy and also useful are Lithium, Antidepressants, 
                          Dopamine agonists and Dietary / Pharmacologic environmental 
                          manipulations. </P>
                        <P> In the evaluation of non-responsive psychosis, there 
                          are several <B>fundamental key symptoms</B> that should 
                          be sought namely anxiety, hostility, manic irritability, 
                          labile mood, extrapyramidal features, tardive symptoms, 
                          depression and nutritional status, diet, use of alcohol, 
                          caffeine and smoking. These lead to different approaches. 
                          The following are highlighted: </P>
                        <P> The first fundamental symptom to be sought is <B>anxiety</B>. 
                          Tachycardia is an important feature in the non-responsive 
                          psychotic, many of whom still seem to have a substantial 
                          degree of anxiety, even after eliminating such obvious 
                          causes as thyrotoxicosis. </P>
                        <P> Most of the literature on <B>benzodiazepines</B> indicate 
                          that they do not apparently relieve anxiety in the psychotic, 
                          except in rare instances in very high doses. Benzodiazepines 
                          can, however, be used in mania, catatonia, for nonspecific 
                          sedation and in epileptics. 
                        <P> On the other hand, there is a substantial body of 
                          research claiming that d1-<B>propranolol</B>, a beta-adrenergic 
                          receptor blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic 
                          activity and a substantial degree of lipid solubility, 
                          may in fact have antipsychotic-like actions. This anti-psychotic 
                          activity of propranolol is not established either empirically 
                          or on theoretical grounds. On theoretical grounds, it 
                          does not have any dopamine antagonism effect and does 
                          not therefore cause any kind of hyperprolactinaemia 
                          or growth hormone alteration. </P>
                        <P> <B>Carbamazepine</B> may be useful in hostility, lability, 
                          temporal lobe pathology and previous hallucinogen usage. 
                          The iminostilbene, carbamazepine, (CBZ) (Tegretol), 
                          is most commonly used as an anticonvulsant and is equally 
                          efficacious to phenytoin in the control of tonic-clonic 
                          seizures and is frequently used in complex partial seizures 
                          and atypical absences, and for trigeminal neuralgia. 
                          Side effects with regard to mental status are far less 
                          than with anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and phenobarbital. 
                        </P>
                        <P> CBZ is being increasingly used in the treatment of 
                          non-epileptic psychiatric patients although not marketed 
                          as such. The improvements in CBZ have consequently been 
                          interpreted as psychotropic actions. These may be a 
                          property of its special anti-convulsant profile or distinct 
                          from it. CBZ is also the prime limbic antikindling agent 
                          in experimental animals. The efficacy of CBZ in psychiatric 
                          illness is attested by increasing literature arising 
                          from Japanese, American and European research, inter 
                          alia, of its use in affective illness. There is a growing 
                          but still limited evidence for its usefulness in both 
                          the prophylaxis and treatment of affective illness and 
                          in non-responsive psychosis. Some uncontrolled evidence 
                          suggests carbamazepine's efficacy may be particularly 
                          marked in those patients who have had affective illness 
                          for periods of many years as opposed to new patients. 
                          Carbamazepine is today probably most often used in the 
                          rapid cycling patient in which fluctuations of mood 
                          have at times been noted over a matter of hours and 
                          days. In contrast, it has also been used only occasionally 
                          in schizo-affective illness and there are supporting 
                          double-blind s tudies However, preliminarily responses 
                          may have related to the affective features. A broad 
                          use of the drug is suggested by this, and it is probable 
                          that its mode of action is different from lithium. Lithium-responsive 
                          and carbamazepine-responsive affective illness may ultimately 
                          represent several separate conditions. </P>
                        <P> The use of carbamazepine has been extended beyond 
                          mood disorder to the non-responsive psychotic. This 
                          has been a consequence of the hypothesized control of 
                          limbic instability by carbamazepine, implying that it 
                          may have effects on schizophreniform illness associated 
                          with temporal lobe dysfunction, or effects on dyscontrol, 
                          or on temporo-limbic instability linked to the non-responsive 
                          psychotic. The only double blind study is Neppe's crossover 
                          study in South Africa of carbamazepine in the non-epileptic, 
                          non-responsive psychotic admitted on the basis of an 
                          electroencephalographic temporal lobe abnormality (the 
                          target feature) and chronic non-responsive psychosis 
                          using 200 mg three times a day. Statistically significant 
                          improvements occurred on all three measuring instruments. 
                          Most interesting was the specific improvement noted 
                          at an interpersonal level. The patients reported being 
                          far more in control of themselves. They felt far less 
                          hostile or aggressive. Serum levels of carbamazepine 
                          suggest a low therapeutic range for seizures, namely, 
                          four to ten mg/l, and this still is the only such study 
                          with information on serum levels. No other double-blind 
                          studies of CBZ in hostility exist and anger ultimately 
                          appeared to be an important consistent factor which 
                          improved. Subsequent to the original Neppe study, numerous 
                          other investigators have found that hostility diminishes 
                          considerably. Consequently, carbamazepine's relevance 
                          to non-responsive psychosis may be particularly important 
                          in controlling hostility. </P>
                        <P> No benefit of carbamazepine on a relatively classical 
                          chronic schizophrenic population occurs. Indeed, possibly 
                          due to the pharmacokinetic decrease of neuroleptic levels, 
                          the schizophrenic patients, in fact, at times deteriorated. 
                          Carbamazepine possibly may be valuable in a specific 
                          subgroup of violent patients. </P>
                        <P> Carbamazepine adjunctive innovative therapy should 
                          be considered in non-responsive psychotics with difficulties 
                          in self-control, previous histories of drug use of hallucinogens 
                          and in patients in whom a kindling-like process could 
                          have occurred. </P>
                        <P> Other anticonvulsants such as phenytoin may at times 
                          have roles. </P>
                        <P> Another group of accessory symptoms to analyze relates 
                          to the presence of an affective component, often labelled 
                          "schizo-affective illness": patients in this category 
                          do not have the affective blunting of schizophrenia 
                          nor do they have the exaggeration of mood that would 
                          suggest affective illness, per se. In these patients, 
                          lithium carbonate or other lithium preparations are 
                          logical attempts at innovative therapy. </P>
                        <P> <B>Lithium</B> may aggravate schizo-affective illness 
                          when used with neuroleptics, increasing the risk of 
                          side effects, but in other instances, improvements have 
                          been reported. Psychomotor acceleration, episodes of 
                          acuity, and pathological excitement have been hypothesized 
                          to be more responsive to lithium. There appears no adequate 
                          way, at present, to differentiate these two opposing 
                          results. The mechanism of effect of lithium manic psychosis 
                          is as yet unknown and until this is clarified its use 
                          in non-affective illness becomes a shot in the dark. 
                          Establishing an underlying biochemical framework for 
                          a drug is necessary. </P>
                        <P> In the non-responsive psychotic with affective features, 
                          alternatives exist. Co-existent depression can be handled 
                          with an <B>appropriate antidepressant</B>, particularly 
                          when patients exhibit symptoms of clinical depression 
                          other than anergia. The heterocyclic and monoamine oxidase 
                          inhibitor groups of antidepressants can induce improvement, 
                          deterioration or no real change in condition. At this 
                          point only clinical judgment can be exercised as to 
                          specific drug choice as there are no special target 
                          features. </P>
                        <P> Another key symptom to be sought in the non-responsive 
                          psychotic is extra-pyramidal features. These must be 
                          adequately treated. The psychotic patient with even 
                          the mildest degree of extra-pyramidal feature may manifest 
                          not necessarily as rigidity, tremor or akinesia but 
                          as very mild akathisia, some degree of listlessness, 
                          or a complaint of mild stiffness. The nonresponsive 
                          relevance is a dynamic one: Such symptoms and signs 
                          may be interpreted by the psychotic that an external 
                          agency is controlling his thinking, affecting his motoric 
                          behavior and his impulses. This sequence can exacerbate 
                          the psychotic condition. Modification of such features 
                          using <B>anticholinergic agents</B> may induce substantial 
                          psychodynamic change in the patient: his delusional 
                          external agency is no longer controlling him and he 
                          may be able to improve. However, anticholinergics have 
                          major disadvantages. A reduction in dosage or a shift 
                          to a more appropriate neuroleptic may be a more appropriate 
                          method of management. </P>
                        <P> One other aspect of innovative therapy of the withdrawn 
                          non-responsive psychotic is controversial: In the absence 
                          of response to dopamine antagonists, add dopamine agonists 
                          such as the various forms of <B>levodopa</B> (combined 
                          for example with bensarimide or carbidopa to prevent 
                          the peripheral dopamine agonist effects). There is a 
                          literature on the use of levodopa in schizophrenia, 
                          and it is interesting that the author has recently described 
                          a series of patients with catatonic stupor, who did 
                          not respond to neuroleptics, but improved from a catatonic 
                          state with levodopa. Following this, they became floridly 
                          psychotic and required neuroleptics in a then-uneventful 
                          recovery. The use of levodopa is innovative therapy 
                          at its most extreme and speculative. </P>
                        <H2>Drug Interactions</H2>
                        <P> The use of combination psychotropic and other drugs 
                          is extremely common. Often the potential for <B>pharmacokinetic</B> 
                          interactions is neglected. This is particularly so, 
                          as almost all are psychotropic agents act other than 
                          the beta-adrenergic blocking agents act directly at 
                          brain level and are lipid soluble. This in turn implies 
                          that they need hepatic drug biotransformation. This 
                          generally involves a particular cytochrome, the P-450 
                          cytochrome enzyme system in the liver. The situation 
                          is complex indeed. At times, the theoretical hypotheses 
                          do not stand up in practice and studies do not demonstrate 
                          marked interaction. It is probable that degree of psychotropic 
                          interactions varies widely among individuals and is 
                          partly genetically determined. Besides hepatic biotransformation, 
                          clearly medications may interfere with absorption of 
                          the drug. Drugs should be administered at the same time 
                          and under similar circumstances each day, for example, 
                          with meals. This may have the advantage of diminishing 
                          side effects. Alternatively, there may be changes in 
                          degree of absorption. Similarly, agents such as antacids 
                          and as noted later common beverages such as coffee may 
                          substantially effect absorption from the gut. </P>
                        <P> In addition to the pharmacokinetic interactions, predominantly 
                          at the hepatic level, and any limitation pertaining 
                          to renal excretion of drugs, a second major consideration 
                          when giving drugs in combination is a <B>pharmacodynamic</B> 
                          effect. This implies that the new drug is having specific 
                          actions in the psychiatric context at the levels of 
                          modification of behavior or psychological functions. 
                          The drug is therefore demonstrating its psychoactive 
                          functions, and these psychoactive functions may be modulated 
                          directly at neurotransmitter levels or indirectly by 
                          modifying complex or basic biochemical cycles. The addition 
                          of one drug to a regimen does not necessarily imply 
                          that its effects on neurotransmitters and hormonal or 
                          biochemical cycles will be exactly the same as if that 
                          drug were given alone. Clearly this is not so, as for 
                          example particular receptors may already be blockaded. 
                          Consequently, side effects of unexpected kind may occur. 
                          A useful principle, therefore, is to prescribe one drug 
                          at a time. If the second drug is added, it should be 
                          added during a period when the side effects and therapeutic 
                          effects of the interaction of the combination regimen 
                          can easily be evaluated. Two drugs should not initially 
                          be prescribed together, because their individual effects 
                          will be more difficult to evaluate. Similarly, not only 
                          should one drug change be made at a time, but only single 
                          dosage changes should be made at any one time, again 
                          allowing better quantification of side effects. In similar 
                          fashion, the effects of a drug initially may not be 
                          the same as the effects of that drug at a later point, 
                          due to changes at kinetic, dynamic and psychological 
                          levels. </P>
                        <P> The role of diet, cigarette smoking, caffeine, and 
                          alcohol in affecting these parameters is very significant 
                          and should always be considered. Cigarette smoke can 
                          induce the P448 and P450 cytochrome systems and alcohol 
                          chronically induces and acutely competes at the P450 
                          level. Nicotine in cigarettes has its own added pharmacology 
                          as does the stimulant caffeine. Finally, diet may effect 
                          absorption, diurnal rhythms, metabolism and have potential 
                          pharmacodynamic and neurotransmitter effects - for example, 
                          tryptophan as a serotonin precursor induces sleep. </P>
                        <H2>Conclusion</H2>
                        <P> A substantial proportion of patients previously regarded 
                          as non-responsive will respond using one or at times 
                          a combination of the above psychopharmacological techniques 
                          with appropriate psychotherapeutic and environmental 
                          interventions. </P>
