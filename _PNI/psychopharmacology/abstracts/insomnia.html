<P>
Of all the problems in psychiatry, possibly the most common is the nonspecific 
symptom of sleep disturbance. One out of three people has occasional sleep 
difficulty, and one out of every six have chronic insomnia.  Disorders of 
sleep can be hypersomnia, insomnia or parasomnia with insomnias classified 
under DIMS, Disorders of Initiating and Maintaining Sleep in which etiologies 
vary: psychophysiologic, e.g. 'jet lag' or shift work. ; psychiatric, e.g., 
depression, mania or anxiety; drugs e.g. caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes 
and nicotine, &quot;pleasure drugs&quot;, certain medications; other 
medical conditions and toxic and environmental conditions e.g. respiratory 
compromise, urinary or pain syndromes; childhood onset disorder of initiating 
or maintaining sleep; and other associated conditions, not specified. The 
treatment of these is the treatment of the causes. There are a variety of 
other confounding variables. Common are the perception of disturbed sleep 
may be different from objectively disturbed sleep; increased difficulties 
with age; and disruption by ones partner.

Our society perceives great credit and great relevance to sleeping less 
than one needs to. The negative impacts in psychomotor responsiveness and 
cognitive awareness are enormous. The chronic insomnia patient particularly 
is at risk in relation to these kinds of phenomena.
</P>

<P>
There are three fundamental facets to insomnia - difficulty falling asleep, 
initial insomnia, difficulty maintaining one's sleep, so called fragmented 
sleep or paroxysmal awakenings, and early morning awakening, terminal 
insomnia as opposed to the first phase of initial insomnia. These reflect 
different symptom complexes but overlap. The nonpharmacologic approach to 
better sleep hygiene are highly relevant.
</P>

The pharmacologic aspects of insomnia is particularly important in 
medicine.  A sedative antidepressant such as amitriptyline or 
trazodone differs markedly from an activating antidepressant such as 
fluoxetine or sertraline.  Some drugs actually cause depression - e.g. 
alpha-methyldopa, reserpine, steroids.  Various treatment options are 
now of limited suitability because of reasons - lack of maintained 
efficacy (e.g. chloral hydrate), to anticholinergic and other 
side-effects ( e.g. antihistamines), to bizarre responses in the second 
half of the night  (e.g. controversially triazolam), to possible 
psychomotor impairments during the day because of maintained effects 
(e.g. flurazepam), to potential dependence, addiction, withdrawal, 
abuse and craving (e.g. benzodiazepines). The emergence of a rapid 
onset, effective, safe, short acting, low side-effect profile, apparently 
non-addictive drug which seems to have maintained efficacy over 
time and which works selectively on only part of the benzodiazepine 
receptor complex is an exciting advance. The first such drug is 
zolpidem tartrate which seems to be a valuable advance.
