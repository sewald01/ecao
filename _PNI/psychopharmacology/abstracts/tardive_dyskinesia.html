<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) has become the single major epidemiological 
scourge in the psychopharmacotherapy of the psychotic patient.  The 
threat of development of abnormal, largely irreversible, involuntary 
movements associated with chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs, 
has created debates as to whether, at times, continued antipsychotic 
drug treatment is appropriate and has substantially changed the 
management of psychoses.
</P>

<P>
Measures of TD are largely inadequate leading to the development by 
the author of the STRAW system of evaluation.
</P>

<P>There are no FDA approved drugs for Tardive Dyskinesia.</P>

<P>
Numerous medications have been attempted for the management of this 
syndrome, with little success. Previously investigated pharmacologic 
interventions have included cholinergic agents, amine synthesis 
inhibitors, amine-depleting agents, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
agonists, calcium antagonists and vitamin E. Most of these agents 
produced inconsistent or temporary effects or were associated with 
unacceptable side effects.
</P>

<P>
Numerous medications accentuate this condition including 
anticholinergics and neuroleptic withdrawal. Additionally, stress and 
serotonin modulating drugs influence outcome.
</P>

<P>
Because TD has been linked to dopamine receptor supersensitivity, 
and associated tardive psychosis may have similar mechanisms, drugs 
which may stabilize, this supersensitivity appear appropriate 
theoretical choices for use in TD. Consequently, the availability of 
the azapirone, buspirone, may be a breakthrough of profound 
significance. This drug seems theoretically and empirically to 
alleviate TD in doses of 120-240 mg/day. The evidence for this is 
discussed based on the author’s research both in Washington state 
and St Louis. The need for double blind studies is emphasized.
