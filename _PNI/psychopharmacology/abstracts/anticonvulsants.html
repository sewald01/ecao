<OL>
  <LI>
    To educate in the area of epilepsy demonstrating the difficulties of 
    research and clinical practice.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To discuss the clinical implications with regard to management options 
    and problems.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To discuss the role of firing and chemistry in the brain and its 
    parallels with seizures, kindling and neuromodulation.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To educate in the areas of anticonvulsant use and their appropriate 
    prescription.
  </LI>

  <LI>
    To evaluate information relating to possible applications of 
    anticonvulsants in neuropsychiatry including mania, dyscontrol, 
    non-responsive psychosis, neuralgia, migraine and atypical 
    headaches.

<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

<P> The use of anticonvulsants have primary indications for epilepsy. They
have become complicated enough for the development of the specialty of
epileptology to have developed. They are not homogeneous in action,
structure, mechanism and indication. These drugs have become a frequent
generally non-approved addition to the armamentarium of the psychiatrist.
Their psychiatric applications may apply to as much as half of their use.
The anticonvulsants are not interchangeable and they differ considerably
in side-effects and the specific subtypes of seizure disorder that they
control. They also vary in possible use in the non-epileptic setting as
well. Frequently these neuropsychiatric conditions are not well-defined in
the context of diagnostic framework for aggression in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual III revision or DSM-IV. </P>

<P>
Anticonvulsants can be divided into two major functional groups:
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    The older, well tested ones such as Phenobarbital and primidone
    (which have little use today because of their side-effect
    profile), phenytoin (Dilantin) (which has limited use outside seizure
    disorders because of its toxicity potential) and
    carbamazepine (Tegretol) and valproate (Depakote, Epilim) (which have
    formed the backbone of modern anticonvulsant therapy
    in epilepsy and beyond to various other neurological and psychiatric
    uses).
  </LI>

  <LI>
    The newer anticonvulsants which are exciting but far less tested
    and on which there is virtually no data as to  psychiatric
    applications. These drugs are all technically marketed in the United
    States as "adjunctive anticonvulsants" as the studies
    examined them as adjunctive therapy to such standards as carbamazepine,
    valproate and phenytoin.  Already such drugs as
    felbamate (Felbatol) have proven potentially dangerous hemopoetically,
    and an apparently safe drug with limited side-effects -
    gabapentin (Neurontin) was perceived as limited in effectiveness, but
    this is changing as dosing is increasing with the drug.
    Lamotrigine (Lamictal) , Tiagabine (Gabitril) and Topiramate (Topamax)
    may turn out to have interesting applications and are
    ripe for further research.

    effectiveness. Lomotrigine and felbamate may turn out 
    to have interesting applications.

<P>
Carbamazepine has potential in the non-indicated management of 
episodic disorders particularly those linked with hostility. 
Preliminary research suggests its use is particularly apposite 
in &quot;Paroxysmal Neurobehavioral Disorders&quot; as a proto
type organic illness with epilepsy like phenomena. The mechanism 
may be via a limbic antikindling effect. Its use in conditions as 
mania and neuralgic pain may be via different mechanisms.
</P>


<P>
Valproate is the broadest spectrum anticonvulsant that we know of 
and the one which has the least side-effects of the first line 
anticonvulsants: less sedation, hemopoetic consequences and 
neurotoxicity than carbamazepine and an effectiveness in both 
grand mal and petit mal seizures. It is effective in both partial 
and generalized seizures. Psychiatrically its the only 
anticonvulsant approved for any condition - in this instance 
mania, and  its use in headache particularly refractory 
headache and migraine are exciting possibilities.
