<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
Three clinical scenarios relate to patients who fail treatment after 
receiving selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor drugs.  Acutely, they 
may experience the "I'm climbing out of my skin" feeling; more 
chronically over several weeks the "It's not working anymore" complaint; 
and over many months an "It worked so well before" amazement.  This 
paper examines theoretical and practical options using <I>combination</I> 
serotonin antidepressant therapy and then looks at <I>new single drug</I> 
approaches.
</P>

<P>
A broader theory of management of such patients can be developed with  
the understanding of concepts such as <I>neuromodulation, partial agonism 
and the serotonin bathtub analogy</I> in depression. The numerous 
antidepressant compounds are evaluated for side-effect profile with 
emphasis on serotonin excess symptoms. Serotonin  modulates many basic 
functions at a large number of levels allowing explanations of why its 
influences are so diverse. In fact, it impacts at physiologic (circadian 
rhythms, hypothalamic pitutiuary function, temperature), behavioral 
(aggression, weight, sex, sleep) and psychological (anxiety, depression, 
obsessionality, stress, memory, lability) levels. The numerous serotonin 
receptor subtypes and specificity is critical to appreciating why drugs 
work and fail and why such paradoxic reactions as anxiety or anti-anxiety 
effects may occur with the same drug in different patients.
</P>

<P>
Drug action at the <I>serotonin 1A</I> receptor subtype is particularly 
important. It involves <I>post-synaptic</I> effects in areas of the 
brain of strategic relevance to psychopathology. The azapirone class 
generally has apparent low toxicity, lack of dependency and sedation and 
selectivity at the Serotonin 1 A receptor with <I>partial agonism</I>  
making their potential application in psychiatry substantial. The only 
marketed 5HT-1A selective drug is the azapirone, buspirone (approved for 
use only in anxiety and mixed anxiety depressive states). However, 
clinical experience in several other areas is interesting but still at 
various early research stages. Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors like 
fluoxetine induce a serotonergic akathisia which can be blocked by 
buspirone. When SSRI compounds stop working with re-exacerbation of 
depression, adjunctive use of azapirones may theoretically extend their 
action. High therapeutic azapirone doses may also imply some modulation 
of obsessionality and weak antidepressant effects.
</P>

<P>
The classic bathtub example relates to the serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitor drugs with their in general <I>unopposed effect of raising 
serotonin</I> levels: this is useful in treating a biological 
depression with ostensible serotonin deficiency. The model is simplistic 
because there are numerous receptor subtypes. <I>Serotonin 2A</I> receptor 
subtype is relevant as <I>blockade</I> appears to be linked with 
anti-depressant effects. The links of sexual libidinal and other 
side-effects, nausea, akathisia, anxiety, agitation, insomnia and 
headache may potentially be modulated by the serotonin excess induced 
by the SSRI drugs. Potentially drugs which have more moderate effects 
on serotonin re-uptake could diminish these effects, particularly if 
they have some serotonin blockade at relevant receptors such as 2A.
</P>

<P>
The unopposed action of serotonin without norepinephric effects in
depression as in the classical SSRI model has major limitations.
Alternatives such as venlafaxine involves both receptors and moreover in
general does not demonstrate the enormous potency of the SSRIs requiring
a modulation of dosage and a far more physiologic approach. Venlafaxine
currently may be the drug of choice in the retarded depression.
Similarly, the development of another antidepressant, nefazodone,
theoretically is an exciting advance as modulation not bathtub filling
can occur at both these receptor levels but
predominantly at the serotonergic level. This should produce
theoretically efficacy with less "overfilling" side-effects. Its marked
bathplug effects such as substantial serotonin 2 A blockade produce the
potential towards anti-anxiety action in the context of depression as
well as some sedation implying applicability for the agitated depressed
patient. Dose limitations may occur as a consequence or because of the
alpha adrenergic hypotensive side-effects.
Strategies for dosing and using the various antidepressants are
discussed.

<P>
The unopposed action of serotonin without norepinephric effects in 
depression as in the classical SSRI model is examined and alternatives 
such as venlafaxine which involves <I>both receptors</I>. The limitations 
of this approach may relate to the dilemma of unopposed action or 
modulation. In this regard the development of a new antidepressant, 
nefazodone, theoretically is an exciting advance as <I>modulation not 
bathtub filling</I> can occur at both these receptor levels but 
predominantly at the serotonergic level. This should produce 
theoretically efficacy with less &quot;overfilling&quot; side-effects. 
Its bathplug effects such as substantial serotonin 2 A blockade 
produce the potential towards anti-anxiety action in the context 
of depression as well as some sedation implying applicability for the 
agitated depressed patient.
