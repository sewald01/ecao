<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The serotonin receptors modulate a variety of basic psychological 
and behavioral functions.  These functions may reflect serotonin 1A 
neuromodulation as well. The serotonin 1A receptor subtype is unique 
because it is found at the raphe nuclei level as the serotonin 
autoreceptor as well as post-synaptically in areas linked with 
limbic function. This may imply differential effects at different 
doses. Because of the low toxicity and receptor specificity of 
serotonin 1A related compounds their potential application in 
psychiatry and medicine is substantial.
</P>

<P>
Several drug groups modulate serotonin 1A receptor action. 
Non-specifically, beta-2-adrenergic receptor blockers (like 
propranolol) produce overall serotonin 1A receptor antagonist 
effects. The benzodioxines, an experimental group, which includes 
eltoprazine, act as partial agonists postsynaptically on both 
5HT 1A and 1B receptors. Lithium cation is very non-specific but 
does impact the serotonin 1A receptor. Serotonin 1A receptor 
action can be measured relatively specifically by the azapirones 
which act as partial agonists postsynaptically and full agonists 
at the autoreceptor.
</P>

<P>
Beta-blockers have impacts on agitation, aggression, anxiety 
and depression. The effects appear bimodal, at lower dosage 
probably reflecting a peripheral beta-adrenergic blockade and at 
higher doses possibly reflecting post-synaptic serotonin 1A 
antagonism.
</P>

<P>
The benzodioxines are being researched specifically in aggression 
and may have a role in modulating serotonin 1A.
</P>

<P>
Agitation, aggression, anxiety and mood all are implicated in 
azapirone function. The azapirones can be used as a pharmacologic 
probe because these effects appear to be dose dependent, in part, 
and because of the specificity at serotonin 1A. At this point, 
most of the research has been performed on buspirone as the only 
marketed azapirone. It is FDA approved for use only in 
generalized anxiety and mixed anxiety depressive states, however, 
clinical experience in several other areas is interesting. Low 
doses of buspirone probably act presynaptically as  may be 
applicable in irritability and lesser agitation; medium doses 
act post-synaptically possibly antagonizing excess serotonin 1A 
modulating anxiety; higher doses are weak agonists and may 
correspond with limited antidepressant effects and  some modulation 
of obsessionality. Doses of the order of 60mg and beyond 
tentatively have possible effects on the irritability, confrontation 
and anger of the manic, although not effecting psychosis or 
sleep-this may imply a serotonin 1A agonist modulating role. 
The scanty literature is discussed.
</P>

<P>
From these approaches, a unified theory linking agitation, 
aggression, anxiety and mood with the serotonin receptor 1A 
subtype and its cross-talk with other receptors can be 
developed.
