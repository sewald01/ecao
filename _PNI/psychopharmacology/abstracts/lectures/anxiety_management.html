<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>
The current classification of anxiety of a separation of panic 
and generalized anxiety disorder has historical and epidemiologic 
limitations. We review alternative perspectives of anxiety viewed 
along the normal - abnormal continuum, as well as the frameworks 
of somatic and psychic anxiety. Similarly, subdivisions into 
adjustment disorder, anxiety states, mixed anxiety / depression 
and organic anxiety disorder lead to a more fruitful approach 
as to the patient’s pharmacologic needs.
</P>

<P>
Future innovative approaches to anxiety paradoxically imply a 
re-evaluation of management over the last century to eliminate 
side-effects and develop customized treatment. Alcohol, bromides, 
barbiturates and meprobamate have all had their problems. The 
benzodiazepines, an apparent major advance, have turned out to 
have benefits with selected but limited indications. This is so 
because of their significant problems.
</P>

<P>
Legitimate alternatives such as antidepressant, beta-adrenergic 
blockers and azapirones are examined. Specialized groups such as 
addicts, medically ill and geriatric patients, have their own 
particular problems. Psychopharmacology is rapidly approaching 
the age of specialized receptorology and serotonin subtypes play 
a major role in management of both anxiety and depression. The 
advent of the azapirones has been a significant advance and may 
exemplify the neuromodulating roles played by varying doses of 
drug impinging on a specific receptor, in this instance serotonin 
1A.
</P>

<P>
Animal models of aggression suggest the azapirones are potent 
anti-aggressive agents. This should be via components of their 
specific serotonin 1A partial agonist effects. Irritability is 
an early target symptom of response with buspirone in generalized 
anxiety disorder possibly implying  persistent low-dose effects.
</P>

<P>
Preliminary open experience by the author suggests low doses of 
buspirone (15-25 mg per day) were effective after a few days in 
alleviating irritability, anger and hostility with or without 
associated significant anxiety.
