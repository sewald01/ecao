 <p align="center"><em><strong>EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON CHILD PRODIGIES (EARLY, PRELIMINARY). &nbsp;Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DFAPA, BN&amp;NP, DPM, MMed,&nbsp;Director,  Pacific Neuropsychiatric Institute, Seattle, WA&nbsp;(Adj Full Professor,  Dept of Psychiatry, St Louis University, St Louis, MO.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.PNI.org/">www.PNI.org</a>;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:psyche@PNI.org">psyche@PNI.org</a>; 206 527 6289</strong></em></p>

 </strong></em></p>
 <p align="center"><em><strong>This is a&nbsp;preliminary &nbsp;model for genius. This requires far more research.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
 <p align="center"><em><strong><br>
 </strong></em></p>
 <p align="center"><em><strong><strong>Empirical Research study</strong></strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>This  paper reports on a preliminary pilot study to evaluate intelligence at the  higher ranges using a different technique, namely applying historical data  about the accomplishments of child prodigies. Child prodigies were chosen  because the extent of their advancements could relatively easily be compared  with older age peers. (Advanced Prodigy)&nbsp;  Exceptional creativity was realized to be rare (Creative [Advanced]  Prodigy). </strong></em></p>
 <h3><em><strong>Child&nbsp; Prodigy criteria </strong></em></h3>
 <p><em><strong>The  following two criteria were used: </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></em><em><strong><em>Profoundly advanced milestones as a child</em></strong></em><em><strong>, not necessarily recognized then as prodigy behavior.  This could include a subgroup that also exhibited profound creative achievement  as a child (which skill / discovery/ invention could not be replicated even by  adults trained in the area). </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></em><em><strong><em>Demonstrable achievement in adulthood</em></strong></em><em><strong>. This generally related to exceptional accomplishment  or education e.g. doctorate (or in young adults, a career leading in that  direction). We excluded the prodigy subgroup who became limited achiever adults  or even disabled. (<strong>High functioning in adulthood&nbsp; AP and CAP),</strong></strong></em></p>
 <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
 <div style="border:thin #000000 solid;">
   <p align="center"><em><strong><strong>Endpoint follow-up of prodigies to adulthood are  trichotomous: <em>This study uses only: </em></strong></strong></em></p>
   <p align="center"><em><strong><strong>1, Successful, demonstrable adult achievement  (excellent but not necessarily outstanding).&nbsp; This study excludes two possibly  more frequent child prodigy groups: </strong></strong></em></p>
   <p align="center"><em><strong><strong>2.&nbsp;  Failure often with psychiatric illness </strong></strong></em></p>
   <p align="center"><em><strong><strong>3.&nbsp;  Clearly there may be a grey area between without active psychopathology  but no achievement.</strong></strong></em></p>
 </div>
 <p align="center"><em><strong><strong>Hypotheses </strong></strong></em></p>
 <div><em><strong>Using analyses based on  outside validated specific milestone achievements, with short vignette  descriptions, the following questions required answering: </strong></em></div>
 <div><em><strong>1, To develop a new method of  determining exceptional intelligence based on key historical vignettes combined  with outstanding general achievement in adulthood, and exceptional achievement  in childhood.&nbsp; This would produce a  new &ldquo;IQ&rdquo; measure called the SCHIQ&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Standardized Corrected Historical IQ). </strong></em></div>
 <div><em><strong>2.&nbsp; To establish if there can be high inter-rater reliability  with historical measures. </strong></em></div>
 <div><em><strong>3, To establish what areas of  the SCHIQ are most difficult to estimate particularly </strong></em></div>
 <div><em><strong>a. Profoundly high IQ </strong></em></div>
 <div><em><strong>b. Very early age achievement </strong></em></div>
 <div><em><strong>c.&nbsp; Number of vignettes required for improved inter-rater  reliability </strong></em></div>
 <div><em><strong>4 This would be a pilot study  where data would be small enough not to apply rigid statistics. </strong></em></div>
 <p align="center"><em><strong>&nbsp; </strong></em></p>
 <p align="center"><em><strong><strong>METHODOLOGY </strong></strong></em></p>
 <h4 align="center"><em><strong><u>Population  for this research </u></strong></em></h4>
 <p><em><strong>An  attempt was made to locate such rare prodigies by using high IQ societies  (e.g., ISPE), as well as approaching very creatively accomplished adult  outsiders known to the author, and asking about very advanced childhood  behavior. </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>This  initial pilot study involved only 7 subjects as true prodigies are rare, A  total of 21 achievements were described during their childhood years (youngest,  6 months; oldest age 19) and their composite 7 adult achievements were also  described. These achievements were each succinctly summarized in 2-4 lines  (examples will be discussed). Generally, the individuals described these, but  outside validating information, when available, was requested so as to ensure  maximal accuracy. </strong></em></p>
 <p align="center"><em><strong><strong><u>Raters and ratings. </u></strong></strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>Three  raters were carefully chosen. All had had major interest, personal involvement,  knowledge and experience in the high IQ measurement domain, substantial  knowledge in research or theory of intelligence, and were involved in  evaluating high IQ individuals e.g. for admission to various high IQ groups.  They ranked the estimated IQ score (standard deviation 15) for each of the 28  individual items described. Their mean IQ estimates of each item were used to  compare interrater reliability though all raters recognized the need for an  item IQ range. </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong><br>
 </strong></em></p>
 <div style="border:medium #000000 solid;">
 <p><em><strong><strong>Examples of Vignettes</strong></strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong><strong>Section A: Early childhood:&nbsp; How would you score the following children? </strong></strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____1.  Aged&nbsp;&nbsp;6 months, he unscrewed a loose plastic screw on his/her baby bed  using his/her fingers and then screwed it back in. This task was  apparently performed spontaneously and completely without any prior  teaching. </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____3.  Aged 2 years 6 months, he could show on the map of the world country,  major cities, major mountains, rivers (&gt; hundred items) </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aged  3.5, he was able to tell the time perfectly to the second (analog  watch). He had never been taught to tell the time, nor had he been  formally shown how to read including arithmetical or roman digits.&nbsp;This  was discovered accidentally by his father when somebody asked the time  and the child responded. </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>__9. Aged 6 years old, he&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>both</strong></strong></em><em><strong><em>&nbsp;developed</em></strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;his own system of mental multiplication for any numbers under 100, and he would&nbsp;<em>apply</em></strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;it by answering in at most 5 to 20&nbsp;seconds depending on the item. He would&nbsp;multiplying any 2-digit&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers  together in his head with 100% accuracy. (A university mathematics  graduate did not understand how he did it &nbsp;until explained in some  detail&hellip;apparently not otherwise ever been used for mental  multiplication although algebraically sound, and almost no adults can  replicate even the calculation feat.* </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____10.  Aged 6.5, he wrote a 80- 90 page on astronomy&nbsp;loaded with digits,  tables and statistics, terminology and enormous detail, without error.  He would study encyclopedias and all available books on the topic, and  his knowledge in the area was regarded as encyclopedic&hellip; </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>* this is an illustration of creative prodigy behavior as it surpasses adult creativity. </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>&nbsp; </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong><strong>Section B:&nbsp;Later childhood: </strong></strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>___11.  Between ages of 5 and 8, he developed what he regarded as a  &ldquo;metalanguage&rdquo; as he wanted to speak English but was not allowed to so  would find English words in the other two languages he knew. (His  parents were in a Japanese concentration camp and the English speakers  were regarded as the enemy). He also began to study the stars in detail  by looking up at the sky. Exposed to three languages in his early  childhood by his family, and fluent in them. </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____12. By&nbsp;age 7.5,&nbsp;&nbsp;his reading age was regarded as that of a 15 year old, with reasonable comprehension.&nbsp;He learnt to read at 5. </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>___18.  Aged 19, he&nbsp;gave a simultaneous chess exhibition to 60 chess club  opponents: He won almost all the games. He had had no&nbsp;previous practice  in any kind of simultaneous chess exhibition. Previously he had never  lost at school at chess in his state. He had no formal chess lessons. </strong></em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em><strong><strong>Section C: older adults. </strong></strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____15.  Theoretical physicist, internationally respected for his creative ideas  despite not being formally educated in any&nbsp; &nbsp;area (even by Nobel  Laureates). </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____16. Made major pioneering creative international contributions in&nbsp;<em>nine completely different</em></strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;disciplines,  including one impacting on millions of people; author reflecting five  completely different disciplines; MD, PhD; recognized with numerous  rare international awards&hellip; recruited internationally </strong></em></p>
 <p><em><strong>____17.  Graduated with highest honors in Bachelor's degree, with distinction in  his Master's degree, and did his doctorate in German with distinction  although he could not speak it previously, and developed a complex  technology on the Internet that had not been solved in sixteen years.</strong></em></p>
