                        <strong><font size="3">What is Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurology? </font></strong> 
                        <P>Neuropsychiatry involves the interface area of psychiatry 
                          and neurology. This is a specialist medical discipline 
                          involving the <I>behavioral or psychological difficulties</I> 
                          associated with known or suspected <I>neurological</I> 
                          conditions such as epilepsy, head injury, attention 
                          deficit disorder, dementia, tardive dyskinesia, atypical 
                          spells, irritability and any organic mental disorder. 
                          Technically, Neuropsychiatry concentrates on the abnormalities 
                          in those areas of higher brain function such as the 
                          cerebral cortex and limbic system. Sometimes difficult 
                          to treat <I>psychological or psychiatric conditions</I>, 
                          including problems relating to <I>medication</I>. are 
                          related to these areas. </P>
                        <P>The subspecialty of neuropsychiatry is the &quot;neurological aspects of psychiatry and the psychiatric aspects of neurology.&quot; All neuropsychiatric patients invariably have a psychiatric aspect as well as a higher brain neurological facet. </P>
                        <P>Neuropsychiatry, now used synonymously with Behavioral Neurology, is the medical subspecialty dealing with the evaluation and management of higher brain functions (cerebral cortex and limbic system).<br>
                        </P>
                        <P>Although&nbsp;Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurology   are regarded as the same specialty,&nbsp; the primary initial specialty directions   may be different. (Neuropsychiatrists may come to this specialty through   psychiatry, Behavioral Neurologists through Neurology).&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the highly specialized nature of this specialty, there   was&nbsp;technically no board   certification in this area until late 2006.&nbsp;This changed when the&nbsp; United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties   (UCNS) introduced&nbsp;Subspecialty Certification of&nbsp;Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry.   (BPNP). These two specialties by so doing merged into   one.&nbsp;psychiatrists specialize in these behavioral facets as do behavioral   neurologists whose discipline is similar. The term Neuropsychiatrist and   Behavioral Neurologist should be restricted to those with psychiatric training   and special background training in the psychopathology of the cerebral cortex.</P>
                        <P>A training in Neurology and in Psychiatry alone does not make one a neuropsychiatrist / behavioral neurologist.</P>
                        <P>One method of training today would be a full four year residency in one or both of Psychiatry or Neurology and then an added Fellowship program e.g. of two years.<br>

                        <P class="style4"><font size="3">Historical Landmarks in Neuropsychiatry in the USA</font></P>
						<P>Dr Vernon M. Neppe MD, PhD, founded&nbsp; the first Division of Neuropsychiatry in a   Department of Psychiatry in the USA in 1986 (at the University of Washington   (UW), Seattle, WA). He directed this division till 1992, offering also   specialized medical student, residency and fellowship rotations in   Neuropsychiatry. Dr Neppe was recruited from overseas (South Africa)&nbsp; by the   then Chairman of Psychiatry, Gary J. Tucker MD,&nbsp; &nbsp;after a national search had   failed. Dr Neppe had previously effectively done what may have been the first   unofficial "Fellowship"&nbsp; in Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurology   (1982-1983)&nbsp;at Cornell University Medical Center (White Plains, and Manhattan,   NY).</P>
						<P>Dr. Neppe&nbsp; then founded the Pacific   Neuropsychiatric Institute in 1992&nbsp; (pni.org). This became the first private   institute dealing with the area of Neuropsychiatry specifically. The PNI was   developed as a model neuropsychiatric and behavioral neurological institute,&nbsp;   clinically involving extremely detailed sequential consultations and testing   plus detailed analyses of psychopharmacogical elements. The PNI focuses, as   well,&nbsp; on research (with the development of numerous questionnaires and tests)   and education. Amongst the most important for this subdiscipline are the <a href="instruments/brocas_scan.html">BROCAS SCAN</a>, the <a href="instruments/sobin.html">SOBIN</a> and the <a href="http://www.pni.org/neuropsychiatry/instruments/inset/index.html">INSET</a>, which are tests that Dr Neppe has developed and modified over the past two decades and are still in the process of research. The <a href="instruments/brocas_scan.html">BROCAS SCAN</a> is an examination of higher brain function, the <a href="instruments/sobin.html">SOBIN</a> and the <a href="http://www.pni.org/neuropsychiatry/instruments/inset/index.html">INSET</a> are structured closed ended and with amplification open ended historical measures of current and past symptoms and signs of neuropsychiatric relevance.</P>
						<P>The <a href="http://www.anpaonline.org/">American Neuropsychiatric Association</a> was established in 1988. It is an organization of professionals in neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences (not necessarily MDs) dedicated to understanding the links between neuroscience and behavior, and to developing effective diagnosis and treatment for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. The <a href="http://www.anpaonline.org/">ANPA</a> members work together in a collegial and interdisciplinary fashion to: advance knowledge of brain-behavior relations; provide a forum for learning; and promote excellent, scientific and compassionate patient care. The interdisciplinary nature of the membership encourages collaborations in research presentations, symposia, workshops and/or continuing education courses. The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences is the official publication of the organization, and is a benefit of membership. ANPA was the brainchild of two   neuropsychiatrists, Barry Fogel, M.D., and Randolph B. Schiffer, M.D.&nbsp;</P>
						<P>An official   sanctioning of the subspecialty&nbsp;of or special interest in&nbsp; Neuropsychiatry in   the early 1990s with the publication based on peer review of the book Best   Doctors in America&nbsp; {Woodward White publishers)&nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;(e.g.&nbsp;<SPAN Times>&nbsp;</SPAN>1st ed., 1992) This publication   was later discontinued. However, another nationally peer reviewed publication,   Castle Connolly's&nbsp; Americas Top Doctors (annual editions since 2001) then became   available.&nbsp; However only a handful or two (depending on listing) of&nbsp;   Neuropsychiatrists per issue achieved such national prominence (Dr Neppe   apparently has been the only one listed in all editions of both these books and   also became the first physician dually listed under Neuropsychiatry and   Behavioral Neurology [as well as Psychopharmacology and Forensic Psychiatry or   later Neuropsychiatry}).&nbsp;&nbsp;These   publications gave further legitimacy to&nbsp; Neuropsychiatry&nbsp;as a   specialized subspecialty. However, Neuropsychiatry was   variably&nbsp;classified&nbsp; as involving special expertise within   Psychiatry (e.g. Dr Neppe) or Neurology (e.g. Dr Cummings) and not necessarily   therefore as a subspecialty.</P>
						<P>There was an indirect label of&nbsp;Neuropsychiatrist previously through the AMA:&nbsp;In   late 2003,&nbsp; the AMA recognized Neuropsychiatry as an&nbsp; official&nbsp;subspecialty of   Psychiatry.&nbsp; Apparently the first MD so listed was Dr Vernon Neppe.</P>
						<P>Over the past few years we are seeing an increasing number of Fellowships in   Neuropsychiatry/ Behavioral Neurology which the UCNS are certifying. An early   Fellowship program was offered at the University of Washington in the&nbsp;Division   of Neuropsychiatry.</P>
						<P>In 2006, the People to People Ambassador program had the first delegation in Neuropsychiatry (and Psychopharmacology). <br>
					    This was a very successful delegation to China. This delegation was led by Dr Vernon Neppe.</P>
						<P>&quot;Behavioral Neurology and Neuropsychiatry&quot; (BN&amp;NP) taken together is now a recognized official subspecialty certified by the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties. (<a href="http://www.UCNS.org">UCNS</a>). The first examination was administered in Sept 2006. 
						  <br>
					    This certification allows an official subspecialty board certification label. The criteria for admission to this   examination are rather stringent and the examination&nbsp; requires a high level of   specialized knowledge.&nbsp; The first graduating group of about fifty (including Dr   Neppe) can use the official abbreviation for this subcertification, namely   &nbsp;BN&amp;NP.&nbsp; A major advance is this recognition of BN&amp;NP as a subspecialty   of Neurology.<br>
