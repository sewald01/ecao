                                great void exists with regard to seizures: DSM 
                                4 does not address the links of seizures and psychiatry. 
                                In DSM 3 R we had the non-specific and diagnostically 
                                inadequate and inaccurate conditions of <I>organic 
                                delusional disorder, atypical psychosis, organic 
                                hallucinosis or organic mood disorder</I>. In 
                                DSM IV, we have <I>"symptomatic disorders"</I> 
                                and <I>"mental disorders due to a general medical 
                                condition"</I> with seizures having no special 
                                pride of place. Epilepsy has remained a predominantly 
                                neurologic and not psychiatric condition and the 
                                limited numbers of psychiatric epileptologists 
                                worldwide have not allowed this situation to correct 
                                itself. </P>

                              <P align="left"> A person is only <B>epileptic</B> 
                                when he has seizures <I>recurrently</I>. An epileptic 
                                seizure involves paroxysmal cerebral neuronal 
                                firing producing clinically relevant changes. 
                                Such seizures may or may not produce disturbed 
                                consciousness. Instead, they may manifest with 
                                other perceptual or cognitive or autonomic or 
                                motor alterations or even what to the patient 
                                may be indescribable types of experiences. In 
                                psychiatric presentations, they may manifest as 
                                subtle episodic behavioral, affective or cognitive 
                                changes which most commonly derive from the temporal 
                                lobe: hence the term <B>Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</B> 
                                - an anatomical origin term replaced today by 
                                the functional and broader non-anatomical description 
                                of <B>"complex partial seizures"</B>. The most 
                                classical and common epileptic seizures are of 
                                the <I>"grand mal"</I> or generalized <I>"tonic 
                                - clonic"</I> kind. These usually involve relatively 
                                short ( 10-30 seconds ) tonic movements with marked 
                                extension / flexion of muscles but no shaking 
                                and then a longer (15-60 sec) clonic tonic manifesting 
                                as rhythmic muscle group shaking. These movements 
                                may be associated with a phase of laryngeal stridor 
                                due to tonic muscles manifesting as a high pitched 
                                scream sound. Urinary and occasionally fecal incontinence 
                                may occur due to sphincteric change and the seizures 
                                are almost invariably followed by headache, sleepiness 
                                and / or confusion. When preceded by perceptual, 
                                autonomic, affective or cognitive alterations 
                                such seizures are <I>partial seizures <B>secondarily</B> 
                                generalized</I>. These partial seizures are classified 
                                as complex partial when any impairment of consciousness 
                                occurs, and as simple partial when there are focal 
                                features but no change in consciousness. Often 
                                this call is difficult to make. An epileptic patient 
                                who experiences special symptoms lasting seconds 
                                referable to the cerebral cortex or limbic system 
                                such as a buzz in his ear, burning rubber smells, 
                                distortions in size, sudden sweating, or uncontrolled 
                                weeping, sudden right arm jerks, or a rising epigastric 
                                sensation may be having simple partial seizures. 
                                However, if the patient experiences with these 
                                symptoms, a strange sense of depersonalization 
                                or of unreality, or a sudden profound mood change 
                                over seconds, or a disorientation sense or loss 
                                of time or a frank absence of consciousness with 
                                no other manifestation, he may in fact be having 
                                subtle alterations of consciousness and the symptoms

                                of patients with epilepsy and psychopathology. 
                                Psychiatric patients are sometimes perceived as 
                                having epilepsy, when in fact they do not. Their 
                                previous labels of epilepsy may relate to a single 
                                seizure, often associated with alcohol or withdrawal 
                                or other medical conditions. Alternatively, they 
                                may have had an acting-out episode, incorrectly 
                                interpreted as a seizure. They may be on anticonvulsant 
                                medication for mood disorder or paroxysmal episodic 
                                behavior disturbance, and the medication may be 
                                misconstrued by a new treating physician as for 
                                seizure control. They may be wrongly on anticonvulsant 
                                medication for black-outs which have not been 
                                proven to be epileptic. Finally, an abnormal EEG 
                                does not make the patient epileptic. It is probably 
                                best to limit epileptic psychiatric patients to 
                                those having a confirmed history of epilepsy associated 
                                with at least two documented seizures which were 
                                not linked to withdrawal phenomena or pyrexia 
                                or other acute events. Conversely, patients who 
                                are epileptic may have periods of altered or impaired 
                                consciousness following on their seizure, with 
                                the resulting confusion producing behavioral disturbances. 
                                This should not be interpreted as psychiatric; 
                                it is clearly a post-ictal confusional state. 
                                Similarly, patients diagnosed with pseudoseizure 
                                phenomena may be having real seizures which have 
                                been misdiagnosed or in addition to their non-epileptic 
                                events. </P>

                                disturbance, may initially be interpreted as psychiatric 
                                in origin. Many such problems relate to the temporal 
                                lobe of the brain. The features of temporal lobe 
                                epilepsy and non-epileptic dysfunction of the 
                                temporal lobe are so varied and so protean that 
                                it is necessary to classify them. I have suggested 
                                the term <B>"Possible temporal lobe symptoms"</B> 
                                (PTLSs) relate to features which can be induced 
                                by stimulating areas of the temporal lobe during 
                                neurosurgery. These symptoms only become specific 
                                symptoms of temporal lobe dysfunction if their 
                                occurrence is validated empirically during a seizure 
                                - either through observation or by the electroencephalogram 
                                (hence the word "possible" in possible temporal 
                                lobe seizures). Great care must be taken in interpretation 
                                of such features : For example, using a phenomenological 
                                analysis, I demonstrated that the symptom of deja 
                                vu commonly regarded as symptomatic of temporal 
                                lobe epilepsy indeed had a very special phenomenologic 
                                quality in patients <I>with temporal lobe epilepsy</I>. 
                                Like many other such focal symptoms, this involves 
                                its association with <I>post-ictal features</I> 
                                such as sleepiness, headache and clouded consciousness 
                                and its link in time with these features. This 
                                association provides an excellent clue to the 
                                existence of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, 
                                deja vu is a normal phenomenon occurring in 70 
                                percent of the population and unless such phenomenological 
                                detail is obtained, patients' symptomatology may 
                                be misinterpreted. I similarly studied olfactory 
                                hallucinations but a specific type of temporal 
                                lobe epilepsy olfactory hallucination could not 
                                be demonstrated although there were suggestive 
                                features. A <I>major message, therefore, may be 
                                the relevance of adequately assessing the symptomatology 
                                of patients presenting with epilepsy. It may be 
                                that this is a direction as relevant as electroencephalographic 
                                monitoring</I>. Most of all it reminds us how 
                                slender our interpretations of other related but 
                                different symptoms such as "he experiences strange 
                                smells" might be and the fact that it is critical 
                                to elicit whether these are episodic in quality 
                                and linked with other symptomatology particularly 
                                epileptic or temporal lobe. A written test instrument 
                                designed to screen for such symptoms which I use 
                                in clinical practice is the <A HREF="../../instruments/inset/">INSET</A> 
                                - The <I>INVENTORY OF NEPPE OF SYMPTOMS OF EPILEPSY 
                                AND THE TEMPORAL LOBE</I> (INSET). The INSET involves 
                                screening for possible temporal lobe, epileptic 
                                and organic symptoms and spells. Thereafter the 
                                symptoms are categorized into several headers 
                                namely nonspecific symptoms, possible and controversial 
                                temporal lobe symptoms, seizure related and other 
                                focal features. The test is based on the subject 
                                and / or his family responding to questions which 
                                are thereafter elaborated in greater clinical 
                                detail. Responses are at two time levels: current 
                                as well as the most common frequency in the remote 
                                past and require the patient to rank frequency 
                                from never through less than yearly to more than 
                                daily (i.e. 0-6). Questions in the INSET have 
                                been based on the earlier Neppe Temporal Lobe 
                                Questionnaire which itself derived from an intensive 
                                literature review on the topic. The INSET plus 
                                medical history is a major determining factor 
                                for whether to order follow-up specialized electroencephalograms 
                                such as <A HREF="../eeg.html">ambulatory EEG</A>.
