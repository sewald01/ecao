                            may be applied at times to terminology: <I>Psychogenic

                            term for patients who have phenomena that resemble 
                            epileptic seizures but which are in reality psychogenically 
                            induced? This is an active area of debate in neuropsychiatry 
                            and epileptology. The number of terms suggested for 
                            such a phenomenon is indicative of the difficult status 
                            of such events in conventional medical terminology. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Two decades ago, clinicians were calling 
                            these events <I>hysterical epilepsy, hysteroepilepsy 
                            or hysterical seizures</I>. The term <I>hysteria</I> 
                            then went out of favour in psychiatry and with it 
                            hysterical seizures. Most common today is <I>pseudoseizures</I> 
                            raising a new area of debate as to its appropriateness. 
                            The events are not seizures hence the <I>pseudo</I> 
                            component. However, they are not pseudo in that they 
                            are extremely real episodes and pseudo implies a disparaging 
                            element to the events. We agree with Trimble on the 
                            pejorative inference on the nature of these episodes. 
                            Patients feel badly, guilty, distressed or resentful 
                            that their condition is perceived in a pseudo-artificially 
                            -sense and that they are being actively accused of 
                            causing it. Whereas this may or may not be true this 
                            perception is unhealthy and inappropriate. Moreover 
                            Slavney emphasizes the active role of the experient 
                            in the pseudoseizure - they are doing it to themselves, 
                            its not happening to them - in this way it is pseudo 
                            but it has implications in primary and secondary gains 
                            such as sick role and attention. Moreover, such events 
                            are generally not consciously motivated: the patient 
                            is not malingering his illness nor is it consciously 
                            performed but for no apparent environmental gain - 
                            factitious. <I>Nonepileptic seizure</I> followed but 
                            this attempt to be neutral in connotation and acceptable 
                            in denotation (Gates and Erdahl) fails because of 
                            the inherent paradox in the terms. <I>Psychogenic 
                            seizure</I>becomes an alternative - again the term 
                            seizure is controversial, although the psychogenic 
                            nature of the event is emphasized. The term <I>psychogenic</I> 
                            in psychiatry has become almost as unfashionable as 
                            hysterical. Camouflage terms reflecting more non-prejudicial 
                            frameworks yet emphasizing the connection with the 
                            body has led to the whole area of <I>Somatoform disorders</I> 
                            being studied. Merskey has suggested several other 
                            alternatives. He emphasizes the <I>conversion</I> 
                            nature of the events and suggests <I>conversion fits 
                            - </I>the problem is it is inaccurate: whereas conversion 
                            phenomena do occur, <I>dissociative</I> elements exist 
                            as well. Moreover, we often refer to conversion in 
                            the context of negative events - paralysis, mutism 
                            and these are classically positive activities. Merskey 
                            also suggests <I>Doxogenic seizures</I>. This introduces 
                            the esoteric term, <I>doxogenic</I>, implying the 
                            patients own mental conceptions and, in fact, Merskey 
                            has also used the term in the multiple personality 
                            disorder implying a common theme which is unproven 
                            and probably unlikely - the two conditions do not 
                            appear to markedly co-exist. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Can terms like <I>epilepsy and seizures</I> 
                            be linked with pseudo or hysterical of somatoform 
                            or conversion or some other equivalent? Not easily: 
                            These events are not <I>seizures</I> so that the term 
                            is inaccurate (Slavney). One cannot broaden the term 
                            seizure to imply other <I>paroxysmal</I> events without 
                            compromising the essential character of epileptic 
                            firing in the brain. If it so broadened such events 
                            as syncope and pain which involve non-epileptic short-lived 
                            episodes of impaired consciousness, sensory perception 
                            discomfort, or motor movements would be so incorporated. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> This then restarts the debate on the 
                            nature of seizures - whether we ought ot be limiting 
                            the term to epileptic firing . Merskey alternatively 
                            raised <I>pseudo-attacks </I>. This brings the debate 
                            on pseudo back to the forefront and introduces a new 
                            source of prejudice namely the <I>attack</I>. Is a 
                            pseudoseizure an attack - if it's psychologically 
                            induced is the patient the victim of the attack or 
                            the cause of the action? Attack seems as prejudicial 
                            as seizure. What terms can be used? We feel badly 
                            about adding to this debate new terms but clearly 
                            the old ones are unacceptable. </P>
                          <P align="left"> There is a need for a term describing 
                            <B>short-lived episodic phenomena of concern to the 
                            patient or those around him</B> - the term <B><I>spell</i></B> 
                            accurately describes this. We feel the term ought 
                            to be <B>non-prejudicial</B> for the patient, not 
                            reflect episodic firing in the brain, allow for the 
                            fact that numerous patients labelled pseudoseizures 
                            actually turn out to have real though <B>atypical</B> 
                            seizures on depth telemetry, and that real seizures 
                            commonly <B>co-exist</B> in patients with pseudoseizures. 
                            We want to emphasize the essential episodic nature 
                            of the events which are usually <B>sudden</B> and 
                            have onsets over seconds and usually last short time 
                            - generally seconds or minutes occasionally hours 
                            or days. Consequently they are paroxysmal. We and 
                            others have used the term <I>spell</I> for a nonprejudicial 
                            way to describe such paroxysmal attacks of altered 
                            or impaired consciousness, behavior, emotions, perceptions 
                            or motoric movements. We need to replace seizure with 
                            something and spell seems more logical than somatoform 
                            seizure for example. There is a major advantage to 
                            using the term spell. Clusters of events can easily 
                            be combined into a disorder or syndrome encompassing 
                            the paroxysmal disorders. Spell is defined is <B>paroxysmal</B> 
                            and delineates the episodic nature of the illness 
                            and is particularly valuable considering our other 
                            suggested related classification of <B><I>Paroxysmal 
                            Neurobehavioural Disorder.</i></B> Spells imply that 
                            these are happening as single discrete episodes in 
                            time and moreover a series of spells of may ultimately 
                            lead to a diagnosis of a syndrome or disorder cluster 
                            e.g. <I>Paroxysmal Somatoform Disorder</I> (Blumer) 
                            which may include also bodily episodes such as faints 
                            or episodic pain or headache. Spells are non-prejudicial. 
                            They do not imply seizure phenomena and yet do not 
                            connote conversion, dissociation, hypochondriasis 
                            or hysteroid behavior either. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Moreover, we want to <B>link with conventional 
                            DSM and ICD nomenclature</B>, now and in the future. 
                            We need to reflect <B>conscious or unconscious behavior 
                            of episodic bodily or mental kind</B> non-prejudicially 
                            and it would be worth having a term such as <B><I>somatoform</i></B> 
                            - resembling bodily symptoms recently introduced into 
                            psychiatric classifications. Indeed, one of us (DB) 
                            has already suggested <I>paroxysmal somatoform disorder</I> 
                            as a possibility. </P>
                          <P align="left"> The Somatoform element we believe to 
                            be useful because it emphasizes the bodily symptoms 
                            elements e.g. many of these patients have pain syndromes 
                            such as headaches. Hence, <B><I>Somatoform Spells</i></B> 
                            which would allow differentiation from syncopal or 
                            pain episodes. People who have repetitive somatoform 
                            spells would have SSD or <B><I>Somatoform Spell Disorder.</i></B> 
                            We respectfully, therefore, add to the tumult of terms 
                            this one. </P>
