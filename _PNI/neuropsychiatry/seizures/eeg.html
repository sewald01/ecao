                          <P align="left"> Electroencephalograms or EEGs are a 
                            basic screening measure of brain waves which is performed 
                            in neuropsychiatry both to detect abnormal firing 
                            in the brain and to find local (focal) abnormalities. 
                            Both sleep and wake EEGs with activating procedures 
                            such as hyperventilation and photic stimulation are 
                            useful as each can give valuable information and demonstrate 
                            abnormalities. Hyperventilation - overbreathing - 
                            which changes the proportion of carbon dioxide in 
                            the body and therefore the acidity / alkalinity level 
                            should be performed only in the absence of medical 
                            conditions contra-indicating it. EEGs appear reasonable 
                            in neuropsychiatric evaluations when there are seizure 
                            history possibilities or possible temporolimbic features 
                            (as reflected on the INSET), or with the episodic 
                            nature of symptoms or a history of atypical spells 
                            . Sleep records have been well demonstrated to more 
                            likely find focal pathology than waking EEGs which 
                            is why they are generally routinely performed now. 
                            However waking EEGs have also have a high pick up 
                            rate and sleep EEGs cannot be interpreted without 
                            the wake EEG justifying a wake record. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Prior to the development of the <B>EEG</B>, 
                            by the neuropsychiatrist, Hans Berger in the 1930's, 
                            all seizure disorders were classified with mental 
                            disorders. EEG technology still remains rather primitive 
                            and reflections of brain waves from the perspective 
                            of analysis of psychopathology somewhat limited. Nevertheless, 
                            the only definitive way of demonstrating that a symptom 
                            or physical sign such as, for example, an olfactory 
                            hallucination is definitely epileptic, is the demonstration 
                            while the person is having that experience of correlates 
                            of seizure phenomena on EEG, such as spike-wave paroxysms 
                            - episodes of half to several seconds of usually sharp 
                            abnormal brain waves, sometimes localized in the brain 
                            e.g. in the right temporal lobe. This demonstration 
                            is unusual unless the seizure phenomena are relatively 
                            uncontrolled, as an EEG is just a short cross-sectional 
                            measure for an hour or two of a patient's life-cycle. 
                            Even in the event of the patient having an experience 
                            which may be a seizure, the EEG correlate may not 
                            necessarily be of a spike wave kind but depending 
                            on location, it could be normal or show a marked slowing, 
                            with a non-specific theta rhythm generally of limited 
                            help unless focal or a delta rhythm, which is frankly 
                            abnormal unless the patient is asleep (theta is 4 
                            to 7 cycles per second, delta is less than 4). It 
                            is occasionally extremely difficult to localize such 
                            features on scalp EEG even when firing is occurring 
                            because symptoms may occur from the mesial temporal 
                            or deep structures within the brain which do not easily 
                            manifest on surface EEGs. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Routine Electroencephalograms (EEGs) 
                            involve both waking records with special activating 
                            procedures such as hyperventilation and photic stimulation 
                            (in the absence of medical conditions contra-indicating 
                            these) as well as sleep records. EEGs should be ordered 
                            not only in possible seizure disorder , but appears 
                            reasonable given any possible temporolimbic features, 
                            episodic nature of symptoms or history of atypical 
                            spells. Sleep records may increase the potential delineation 
                            of focal abnormality such as a temporal lobe focus 
                            by approximately fourfold than waking EEGs. However 
                            waking EEGs have a high pick up rate and sleep EEGs 
                            cannot be interpreted without the wake EEG so both 
                            should be performed. A normal EEG does not imply absence 
                            of epilepsy. </P>
                          <P align="left"> EEGs are possibly under-used in psychiatry 
                            partly because electroencephalographers have a broader 
                            range of what constitutes normality searching mainly 
                            for focal and seizure phenomena. They are generally 
                            not psychiatrists and potentially valuable research 
                            and clinical information may be lost. For example, 
                            testable hypotheses are that relatively flat EEG tracings 
                            may be more common in certain personality disorders, 
                            with certain psychotropics, or in a subpopulation 
                            of schizophrenia. Seldom is this kind of background 
                            even reported on. </P>
                          <P align="left"> The administration of chloral hydrate 
                            (e.g. 1 gram as premedication) prior to the sleep 
                            record is useful as this induces sleep with little 
                            changes of significance in the electroencephalogram 
                            and does not prevent the demonstration of focal abnormalities. 
                            Certain medications should be particularly avoided 
                            in EEGs. The benzodiazepine group are the worst offenders 
                            as by virtue of their very strong anti-epileptic effects, 
                            they have profound effects in normalizing the EEG. 
                            Such effects at a receptor level may last weeks even 
                            with the apparent short acting benzodiazepines so 
                            that the yield of demonstrating epilepsy after the 
                            patient has had benzodiazepines administered apparently 
                            decreases substantially, although adequate data in 
                            this regard is not easily available. </P>
                          <P align="left"> <I>Special electrode placements</I> 
                            may increase yield by a few percent, but are seldom 
                            used today: With <I>nasopharyngeal</I> electrodes, 
                            the greater yield was insubstantial; and <I>sphenoidal</I> 
                            electrodes placement, unfortunately, requires time 
                            and expertise and cause discomfort limiting their 
                            use. A recent suggestion which I recommend has been 
                            the placement of electrodes on the buccal skin surface 
                            in the area of the <I>submandibular notch</I> - possibly 
                            as effective in picking up foci as sphenoidal placements. 
                            Specialized centers use <I>cerebral cortical or submeningeal 
                            strip</I> placements during neurosurgery procedures 
                            and these may show firing, for example, in patients 
                            with temporal lobe epilepsy and psychosis, in the 
                            region of the hippocampus. The direct placement of 
                            intracranial electrodes shows how commonly spike firing 
                            may be occurring in this area with no correlate of 
                            any kind on surface EEGs. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Developments in this regard have been 
                            rapid over the past few years. <I>EEG Telemetry</I> 
                            involves prolonged monitoring over periods of time 
                            varying from 12 hours to 2 weeks while the patient 
                            is generally confined to a particular room. <I>Cable 
                            telemetry</I> is most commonly used. This involves, 
                            for example, a 25 foot cable connected to the EEG 
                            montage on the patient's head. Very often no seizure 
                            manifestations are picked up for prolonged periods 
                            of time because seizures only occur paroxysmally. 
                            Moreover, those patients evaluated in a specialized 
                            center with EEG telemetry are invariably so atypical 
                            that the hypothesized seizure originates deep within 
                            the brain. The apparatus is very expensive and the 
                            costs involved in monitoring patients are thousands 
                            per day at times for two weeks. Instead, home ambulatory 
                            electroencephalograms are easily available and should 
                            in psychiatry become the state of the art. </P>

                            (EEG) with the patient not modifying medication is 
                            a valuable test as the patient's symptomatology can 
                            be monitored day and night in a natural environment 
                            of home using computerized filtering of artefact. 
                            The advantage of this technique is to establish if 
                            any scalp electrode can detect events such as atypical 
                            spells alerted to by pushbuttons which could be reflecting 
                            deep brain electrical activity . It has limited availability 
                            at this point, however, but our pick up rate for atypical 
                            spells (paroxysmal neurobehavioral disorder) and seizures 
                            is very high - a major advance over routine electroencephalography.

                          <P align="left"> Recent advances in EEG technology may 
                            ultimately change the whole perspective in its use 
                            in psychiatry. <I>Computerized EEG</I> monitoring 
                            allows breakdown of wave forms and allows correlation 
                            with evoked potentials including cognitive evoked 
                            potentials. It also facilitates demonstrations of 
                            changes in particular areas of the brain which can 
                            be easily delineated at a visual level. This should 
                            prove to be a useful psychophysiological correlate 
                            of psychopathology. Indeed, this may be the beginning 
                            of an important new era. However, at this point in 
                            time it is still experimental. </P>
