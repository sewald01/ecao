                           <P align="left"> Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological condition with impairments of the sleep-wake cycle. Narcolepsy manifests with four symptoms, the so-called classical tetrad:
							<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                            <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>a) Episodic irrepressible uncontrollable Day-Time Sleepiness (DTS) is the key feature, and
							<LI>b) Abnormal bilateral episodes of muscle tone loss with clear consciousness (cataplexy) make the diagnosis <LI>definitive. Common but not necessarily required symptoms are

							<p align="left">*This series of articles focuses on the areas where the mythology may need to be broken and where limitations may not necessarily be recognized. This article has several parts, each interrelated yet independent. As with all publications, information such as this must be considered only after consultation with physicians and any medical information recorded here should not substitute for such consultations.</p>
			<H1 id="abstract">Introduction</H1>
					<P align="left">Diplopia and nocturnal insomnia are two other often ignored common symptoms.
					<P align="left">The classical standard narcolepsy research criteria confirming a narcolepsy diagnosis consist of either a positive multiple sleep-latency tests (MSLT), or an abnormally low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Orexin (hypocretin) level. I focus on some controversies:
							<p align="left"><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                            <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>a) First, the genes for narcolepsy have been largely ignored when applying the recognized criteria for diagnosing narcolepsy. These genes include particularly DQB1*06:02. However, the DQA1*01:02 gene should also be measured 1:02.
							<li>b) Secondly, the multiple sleep-latency test (MSLT) may be overemphasized for definitive diagnosis, because the genetic test is as important or even more relevant. This is pertinent because, in the USA, insurance approval of costly medications such as modafinil, armodafinil and sodium oxybate are often dependent on the insurances applying a positive MSLT as a requirement; when it is negative, the insurances might tragically deny coverage of these medications: This might deprive many in the narcolepsy population of their essential life-sustaining treatment, even though they might have definite clinical features plus the gene expression, and often, already, response to wakefulness drugs.

					<P align="left">I suggest a new model of hypocretin deficiency being slightly down-stream from the actual cause of narcolepsy-cataplexy. This accentuates the need for proposing two new terms, namely ???primary narcolepsy??? for the most common narcolepsy condition that appears to be hypothalamically linked to an auto-immune process involving hypocretin, and ???symptomatic narcolepsy??? due to infectious or tumor or trauma events involving the hypocretin / reticular activating system/ hypothalamus. On the others hand, some 
					old classifications have used the previous terms "Type 1
					Narcolepsy" for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and "Type 2
					Narcolepsy" for narcolepsy without demonstrated cataplexy:
					this classification appears redundant and has ambiguities
					(e.g. some require proof by MSTL or Orexin levels and some
					do not). The various ICSD and DSM criteria are re-examined.

		<H1 id="condition">Narcolepsy: The condition: Part 1</H1>
				<h3>The classic clinical tetrad</h3>
				<p align="left">Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological condition resulting
				from impairments of the sleep-wake cycle, in which patients
				necessarily uncontrollably fall asleep during the day. (Day
				Time Sleepiness or DTS). They might also often have symptoms
				pertaining to abnormal muscle tone episodes (cataplexy). When
				the DTS is combined with the cataplexy, the clinical diagnosis is
				definitive. There are two other frequent symptoms, namely sleep
				onset distortions ("hypnagogic hallucinations"), and waking up
				during the night from sleep and experiencing paralysis ("sleep
				paralysis").
				<p align="left">Day-time sleepiness (DTS) involves recurrent periods of an
				irrepressible need to sleep: This is uncontrollable and even may
				occur while driving, when patients learn to quickly go to the side
				of the road, but where they are at major risk for car accidents.
				They then lapse into sleep, and they may nap several times within
				the same day.
				<p align="left">Cataplexy involves brief episodes of sudden bilateral loss of
				muscle tone, most often linked with intense emotion.
				<p align="left">This therefore constitutes the classical clinical Narcolepsy
				tetrad (four major symptoms) of:
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>i) Day time sleepiness (DTS) and cataplexy, particularly,
				<li>ii) Plus the two other accessory features of hypnagogic
				hallucinations and sleep paralysis.</TD></tr></TABLE>
				<p align="left">These two accessory features are, at times, elicited and
				sometimes documented, even at a lab level, but they are clinically
				pertinent, though often neglected.
				
				<h3>Standard criteria</h3>
				<p align="left">The standard research criteria applied to confirm a narcolepsy
				diagnosis consist of either the multiple sleep-latency test (MSLT),
				and / or measures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Orexin.
				<p align="left">The data in this Part 1 points to some key information, yet
				because it is highly concentrated, some concepts may seem
				difficult to follow, at this point. But this broad overview might
				provide a perspective when later on I cover each concept in more
				detail and accentuate two key points:
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>i) I illustrate specifically a controversy of the gene for narcolepsy
				largely being ignored, even in the criteria for narcolepsy, and
				yet a possible overvaluation of multiple sleep-latency test
				(MSLT) sleep tracings being used for definitive diagnosis.
				This is important because in the USA insurance approval of
				expensive medications is often dependent on the MSLT being
				positive and when negative it might deprive many in the
				population of essential life-sustaining treatment.
				<li>ii) I also emphasize the need for clinical evaluations to be
				standardized, and point to modifications of the Epworth
				Sleepiness Scale in conjunction with the Fatigue Severity
				Scale, and the Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire.</TD></tr></TABLE>
				
				<h3>Genes</h3>
				<p align="left">The usual clinician does not have access to such specialized
				tests, yet every clinician can ask for the Narcolepsy gene test (e.g.
				the main one is HLA DR DQB2 06:02), and this correlates very
				highly with Orexin in narcoleptic patients (90% or higher e.g.
				92%) [1,2]. The problem is it has false positives in about one tenth
				to one third of patients depending on the population.
				<p align="left">In our clinical experience spanning over two decades of
				evaluating such narcolepsy patients, these false positives
				expressing the narcolepsy gene (usually "DQB 06:02") are not
				just "control" normal patients. Every one of these controls in
				our neuropsychiatric population, has had some kind of sleep
				disturbance. But detailed history shows that these "controls"
				exhibit lifelong symptoms of different sleep disorders though not
				clinical narcolepsy. Because other symptoms like depression or
				anxiety may not be sufficient in many of these cases, it is that likely
				that many of these patients have other "primary dyssomnias"
				and often such conditions have not been well delineated. Yet,
				commonly the families of these "controls with positive narcolepsy
				gene expression", have classical narcolepsy, also with their HLA
				"DQB 06:02" gene being expressed.
				<p align="left">The utility of genetic testing for narcolepsy was recognized
				even by 2002 [3], and the specific HLA DR2 "narcolepsy" gene was
				reported in 1984 [4,5].
				<p align="left">But narcolepsy gene testing has remained extremely underrated
				by many experts who have preferred the far more expensive,
				specialized, and time-consuming "multiple sleep-latency test"
				(MSLT) test instead. Yet, in our experience, the HLA typing for
				the narcolepsy gene can be performed as a simple genetic blood
				test that provides powerful confirmatory data when used as an
				addition to the clinical data Indeed, in our experience the gene
				plus clinical data, as shown later in this article, provides as strong
				or even stronger diagnostic support than the MSLT test.
				
				<h3>More complex testing</h3>
				<p align="left">Whereas the sleep-onset MSLT, and the Orexin CSF tests are
				valuable to have available as extras in cases of further diagnostic
				query after detailed clinical plus gene evaluation, they are
				specialized because of their costs (MSLT) or invasiveness (CSF)
				and require specialty involvements.
				<p align="left">I know now that narcolepsy is regarded as due to Orexin
				deficiency [1] in the hypothalamus. This may or may not be
				an auto-immune process, as sometimes trauma or infection
				can induce it in predisposed individuals. But that can only be
				measured using cerebrospinal fluid: So this is not something
				easily accessible to many clinicians.
				<p align="left">Orexin deficiency correlates strongly with the most commonly
				used standard sleep lab test, the MSLT (possibly 95% ref). The
				MSLT involves a measure of how often patients go directly into
				rapid eye movement sleep within say 8 minutes of going to sleep
				during the day under standard precautions. This is an expensive
				test, but when it is positive and applied with all its required
				stringencies, such as not having sleep for (say) six hours before,
				and not having taken confounding medication, it provides strong
				support for the diagnosis the narcoleptic condition. Moreover,
				the MSLT can be applied sequentially to monitor medication
				responses.. But, there is commonly a tragic problem in the USA.
				When the MSLT results are negative and yet the clinician based
				on structured questionnaires, gene testing and pharmacological
				response regards the narcolepsy diagnosis as definite because
				these same patients may not be authorized to receive their very
				expensive wakefulness medications from the insurance company.
				This is because the insurance industry have taken the criteria of
				diagnosis of MSLT as the most definitive.
				<p align="left">A negative MSLT, in the presence of positive other testing and
				even medication sample response, is not a rarity, unfortunately, in
				our experience. This is because only slightly more that one fifth of
				narcoleptics have a positive MSLT on the first run of the test [6]:
				Usually 2 such positive tests out of four, five or six, are required.
				Moreover, some researchers that there are false positive MSLT
				results: Depending on the population this may be as much as
				about 3 in 10 positive MSLT cases not even having narcolepsy [7].
				<p align="left">Positive MSLT test results vary with age, specific symptoms in
				populations, and other confounding factors [1,8]. Yet, proponents
				of the MSLT, and this includes most sleep laboratories, claims
				the MSLT is the most definitive test for narcolepsy, so that this is
				conflict with the above:
				<p align="left">The data suggests that the MSLT cannot be used purely in
				isolation to confirm or exclude narcolepsy. Many experts believe it
				is now indicated only in selected patients with excessive daytime
				sleepiness. And almost every specialist agrees it is most valuable
				when interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings [7]. It may
				be that a useful, but as yet unperformed definitive controlled
				study would be the proportion of patients expressing Clinical
				features plus HLA-DQ2-06:02 typing who have positive MSLTs
				and what proportion are of MSLT patients do not express any of
				the implicated HLA-DQA and DQB genes.
				
				<h3>Age</h3>
				<p align="left">Narcolepsy usually has an onset at an early age (childhood,
				adolescence or young adulthood), but is often missed till late [9],
				the mean delay to diagnosis is up to 15 years, with rare individual
				cases being delayed even for 60 years, though with education,
				there might now be a shorter delay to diagnosis.
				The delay in diagnosing narcolepsy may sometimes be linked
				with the frequent association with other sleep-wake disorders
				[10].
				<p align="left">In my opinion, many cases are never diagnosed. Misdiagnosis
				or absence of diagnosis is a key problem. Early diagnosis of
				narcolepsy has the possibility to offer affected persons an adequate
				medication to lead an almost normal life and the future possibility
				to cure narcolepsy through immunomodulation therapy [10].
				
				<h3>Comorbidity</h3>
				<p align="left">Lack of symptom recognition is unfortunate, because narcolepsy
				has a high comorbidity burden. Many disorders manifest with
				symptoms that overlap with narcolepsy and patients are labeled
				bipolar, schizophrenic, depressed and anxious. These detrimental
				effects impact on proper health-care being used, employment,
				and quality of life. Education and awareness of narcolepsy and its
				symptoms might assist [9].
				<p align="left">Moreover, particularly in the young, the symptoms can be
				disabling enough to interfere with functioning of the child, and
				therefore compromise his/her education. That in turn leads to
				further stigmata and impairments.
				<p align="left">Men and women have very similar narcolepsy related
				symptoms. But women may be more likely to be diagnosed later:
				85% of men were diagnosed by 16 years after symptom onset
				(still a long time), compared to a 28 year delay in women (a very
				long time). One wonders whether the large gray area are those
				who are undiagnosed [11].
				<p align="left">Interestingly, despite being more objectively sleepy (e.g. on
				MSLT), women were far less likely to report lifestyle impairments
				in the areas of personal relationships and physical activity, but
				were also slightly more likely to self-medicate with caffeine [11].
				However, most important may be a way for clinicians to easily
				and cheaply make the diagnosis clinically without having to resort
				to tests such as MSLT, and CSF Orexin levels.
				This is what this paper is about.
				
				<h3>Gold standards</h3>
				<p align="left">No real gold standard currently exists for the diagnosis of
				narcolepsy. Conventional diagnostic criteria are unwieldy and
				arbitrary. Clearly defined criteria for case selection are needed to
				compare the results of different studies [3].
				<p align="left">However, these criteria require highly specialized evaluations,
				and therefore are limiting.
				<p align="left">Currently, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders
				(ICSD) Revised 4 represents the research "gold standard" for the
				diagnosis of narcolepsy. It begins with the classical association of
				recurrent daytime naps and cataplexy and this has now become
				sufficient for a definite diagnosis, because the cataplexy symptom
				is so specific.
				<p align="left">But there are many patients without cataplexy, who have
				daytime sleepiness and other associated features. In a specialized
				setting, sleep studies may greatly contribute.
				<p align="left">The criteria have changed minimally over the years. For
				example, in DSM 4TR is very close [12]. DSM-V [13] has improved
				this a little and now recognizes Sleep Paralysis. It also emphasizes
				co-morbidity of Narcolepsy diagnoses with Schizophrenia
				and Bipolarity. Whereas, in my opinion, this might be true, it
				also might not be, because narcolepsy experiences manifest in
				different ways and may be misdiagnosed. One measure may be
				pharmacological responsiveness to appropriate neuroleptic, for
				example, in appropriate dosage [14,15].
				<p align="left">However, the linkage may be pertinent, as well, in some patients:
				Preliminarily, there is a higher frequency of DQ B1(*)-03:01/06:02
				antigens in N-C children with narcolepsy and cataplexy who
				develop what Huang is calling "secondary schizophrenia". This
				linkage is a therapeutic challenge where there may be long-term
				persistence of severe psychotic symptoms [16].
				Importantly, diagnoses are also by exclusion so DSM 4R
				included, as it does for almost every other condition: The
				classic phrase for all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
				Disorders comments is: "The disturbance is not due to the direct
				physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
				medication) or another general medical condition".
				<p align="left">Interestingly, at one point, we spoke of narcolepsy, type 1 (with
				cataplexy) and narcolepsy, type 2 (without). This is really extra
				verbiage, unnecessary particularly as some have tried to suggest
				special criteria for qualifying for Type 1 and Type 2-eventually
				very few would qualify.
				
				<h3>Let's now list minima that are usually mentioned</h3>
				<p align="left">Remarkably there are amazing omissions such as sleep
				paralysis in the clinical DSM criteria and genetic components in
				the ICSD criteria. Let's examine this in the light of recent history:
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>1. Day-time sleepiness frequency at minimum should be at least three times per week over the past 3
				months.
				<li>2. The presence of at least one of real cataplexy or cataplexy equivalent in children should occur at least a

				<li>a. In individuals with long-standing disease, cataplectic events can be brief (seconds to minutes) episodes

				joking.
				<li>b. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset, spontaneous grimaces, or jaw-opening episodes
				with tongue, thrusting or a global hypotonia, without any obvious emotional triggers, are allowed.
				<li>3. Recurrent intrusions of elements of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep into the transition between sleep
				and wakefulness, as manifested by either hypnopompic or hypnagogic hallucinations or sleep at the
				beginning or end of sleep episodes

				medication) or another general medical condition.

				<h3>a) The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)
				ICSD 4R</h3>
				<p align="left">ICSD 4R is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of
				narcolepsy and reflects the criteria for the sleep association.
				<p align="left">The classical association of recurrent daytime naps and
				cataplexy is sufficient for a definite diagnosis, the latter symptom
				being specific. That appears logical.
				<p align="left">However, there is a wide spectrum of cases without cataplexy,
				where daytime sleepiness and other associated features
				are evocative but not specific, then according to the ICSD
				polysomnographic studies are mandatory. As you will see in this
				paper, with due respect, I regard, in a clinical practice, genetic
				studies as not only adequate, but mandatory with or without
				Polysomnography.
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>347.00 (G47.419) Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin

				347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin

				Table 1B: ICD 9 and ICD 10 diagnoses.</td></tr></table>
				
				<p align="left">There are confounders with sleepiness in patients with
				narcolepsy without cataplexy, idiopathic hypersomnia,
				and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome creating needs for
				Interobserver Reliability in the ICSD Diagnostic Criteria for
				Narcolepsy [17].
				<p align="left">The ICSD-3 of 2014 provides new terminology, classifications,
				and diagnoses for this disorder that's characterized by daily
				periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep.
				This change was made because some patients demonstrate what
				they consider the fundamental cause for narcolepsy type 1 namely
				hypocretin deficiency but without cataplexy. The data presented
				in this article may suggest however that that fundamental cause
				is an early result of hypothalamic change and that the genetic
				elements may even be more relevant to causality. I do not see
				this classification as bringing anything further to the table, except
				limiting the diagnosis profoundly to MSLT, polysomnography and
				CSF Orexin, and possibly incorrectly excluding genetic testing, or
				even pharmacological responsiveness, and excluding most of the
				population with narcolepsy because they do not qualify on testing.
				<p align="left">However, this classification at least widens clinical criteria
				to include both daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or
				daytime lapses into sleep, but may narrow patient diagnosis,
				in terms of episodes not being daily. This to me, with respect, is
				problematic.
				<p align="left">The ICSD has revised the classification of narcolepsy and this is
				more sensible: ICSD Revised 4 represents the new gold standard
				for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Now the classical association of
				recurrent daytime naps and cataplexy is sufficient for a definite
				diagnosis, the latter symptom being specific. On the other hand,
				if there is doubt, in the wide spectrum of cases without cataplexy,
				where daytime sleepiness and other associated features are
				elicited, but not specific, polysomnographic studies are then
				mandatory.
				<p align="left">We can go back in time: There is an extended history across
				these cultures attributing these symptoms to supernatural
				causes. These involve entities "incubi" dating back to the times
				of Martin Luther, or the Newfoundland "Ag-Rog" or "Old Hag" or
				by the 1970s, "alien abduction". This mythology is usually linked
				to nocturnal sleep episodes either the sleep paralysis which is
				non-specific and not diagnostic, or the hypnagogic (sleep-onset)
				or hypnopompic (sleep awakening) hallucinatory experiences.
				This may lead to further distressing dynamics, and these beliefs
				might partly relate to the "true nightmare" [18]. Interestingly,
				these kinds of interpretations with altered consciousness are not
				unusual, particularly in a related episodic condition with defect of
				consciousness, epilepsy [19].
				
		<h1 id="features">Narcolepsy: the Key Clinical Features: Day-time Sleepiness and Cataplexy. Part 2</h1>
				<p align="left">In this section, I discuss the two key features of Narcolepsy
				namely:
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>i) Daytime Sleepiness and
				<li>ii) Cataplexy</td></tr></table>
				<p align="left">Without Daytime Sleepiness there can be no diagnosis of
				Narcolepsy. It is a sine qua non. There can be narcolepsy without
				cataplexy, and sometimes is in about a third of cases. % But if
				there is cataplexy, with classical Daytime Sleepiness the diagnosis
				effectively is indisputable.
				<p align="left">Let's examine both of these briefly:
				
				<h3>Day Time Sleepiness (DTS)</h3>
				<p align="left">Daytime sleepiness attacks in narcolepsy involve recurrent
				periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or
				napping occurring within the same day.
				<p align="left">One description is "Irresistible attacks of refreshing sleep".
				Another conceptualization is these attacks are short-lived.
				Frequently, they may last half an hour and then the patient is
				refractory to another such attack for several hours e.g. 2 hours.
				The patient After the DTS attack, the patient feels remarkably
				refreshed. An essential component of this classical DTS is
				the episodic element. That differentiates them from chronic
				maintained states of sleepiness.
				<p align="left">The minimum frequency varies for these to be considered
				narcoleptic: The ICSD requires occurrence at least three times
				per week over the past 3 months. DSM 4 R required at least daily.
				More pertinent may be the associated activities: For example,
				post-prandially an hour after a high carbohydrate lunch, patients
				prone to hypoglycemia may become sleepy.
				<p align="left">Clinically, in narcolepsy, I distinguish between physical
				tiredness and true uncontrolled daytime sleepiness with the
				onset or REM sleep.
				
				<h3>Nuggets</h3>
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>i) The patient still only sleeps 7 or 8 hours per 24 hours. This
				means patients have insomnia at night. They do not sleep
				7-8 hours at night but less to make up for their micro-sleeps
				during the day. Narcolepsy is often classified, in my opinion
				incorrectly, as a "hypersomnia". This would refer to a disorder
				of increased sleep in the 24-hour day. It is not a hypersomnia,
				but a "dyssomnia" with breakage of sleep distribution: the
				disorder of increasing short nap sleeps during the day is
				countered by insomnia at night to make up the 7 or 8 hours
				required for mean sleep during the 24-hour period.
				<li>ii) Almost every narcoleptic I've seen has had motor vehicle
				accidents where they've fallen asleep. This is not quite as
				dangerous as seizure disorders with loss of consciousness
				when there is no warning. But narcoleptics often can pull
				over to the side of the road (a few seconds warning) but this is
				still dangerous, requires medical review, and unless the DTS
				is excellently controlled these patients should not be driving,
				and even if well-controlled should recognize that driving is
				their responsibility and should be for short trips only under
				medical and prescription supervision.
				<li>iii) Therefore, when they take appropriate medicines e.g.
				Modafinil and Armodafinil they are much better and may
				not be dangerous. Epileptics are sometimes completely
				controlled on anti-convulsants and the criterion for driving
				there varies with jurisdictions e.g. 3, 6, or 12 months or
				doctor's opinion.</td></tr></table>
				<p align="left">How do I measure the DTS in a clinically standard way? The
				best way, I think, is applying two scales such as the Modified
				Epworth Sleepiness Scale (MESS) [20-22] with the PNI Fatigue
				Severity Scale (PFISS) [22]. If there are any clues to narcolepsy,
				such as a MESS score of 10 or more, with a FISS-1 score of 20
				or less, we then apply a standardized questionnaire, such as
				The Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire (NNQ) [23-25]. These are
				discussed later.
				
				<h3>Cataplexy</h3>
				<p align="left">Cataplexy is a medical condition involving sudden and transient
				episodes of usually bilateral muscle weakness is accompanied by
				full conscious awareness. This is due to a sudden loss of muscle
				tone, and is most often associated with intense emotion (although
				there are exceptions). The fact that this is bilateral-on both
				right and left sides together-and occurs in clear consciousness,
				differentiates cataplexy from seizure disorders.
				<p align="left">Cataplectic attacks vary in severity depending on the incident
				and the individual:
				<p align="left">Sometimes cataplectic attacks involve sudden minimal
				weakness, such as barely perceptible slackening of the
				facial muscles; alternatively, a cataplectic attack might manifest
				marked physical collapse with loss of muscle tone and strength,
				where the body falls helplessly, though remaining conscious.
				A basic diagnostic issue is that cataplectic attacks are almost
				invariably triggered by strong emotions such as laughing, crying,
				or terror.
				<p align="left">Cataplexy affects about 70% of people who have narcolepsy
				[26]. Occasionally, cataplexy precedes the classical EDS. The
				extent of severity varies.
				<p align="left">Cataplexy as a symptom is sometimes difficult to conceptualize.
				When trained, raters are "almost perfect" in observing the
				videotaped physical signs after training [17]. But ordinary mental
				health specialists don't have that training and don't see such
				attacks: Therefore a standardized question series such as the NNQ
				should be useful. Again the NNQ is valuable in this [23,24].
				<p align="left">Cataplexy manifests as muscular weakness attacks that are
				brief, and most last from a few seconds to a couple of minutes.
				<p align="left">Typically, attacks could involve any or all of dropping of the
				jaw, neck weakness, and/or buckling of the knees. Complete fullblown
				muscle paralysis with postural collapse may occur [27-29].
				Speech may be slurred and vision may be impaired (double vision,
				inability to focus) [30], but hearing and awareness remain normal.
				<p align="left">Cataplexy attacks are self-limiting and resolve without the
				need for acute medical intervention [27-29]. If the person is
				reclining or lying down comfortably, the patient may transition
				into one of the other narcoleptic features namely, sleepiness,
				hypnagogic hallucinations, or a sleep-onset REM period [31].
				<p align="left">Cataplexy worsens with fatigue, and it might rarely not
				be triggered by the usual strong emotional reactions such
				as laughter, anger, surprise, awe, and embarrassment. Sudden
				physical effort may trigger it, and being caught unawares or off
				guard may trigger it or it may be quite spontaneous with no
				identifiable emotional trigger.
				<p align="left">Cataplexy is very varied and more difficult to assess.
				<p align="left">It varies from minimal muscle tone-hardly noticed, to
				major episodes e.g. drop attacks. It often is bilateral, on both
				sides. Cataplexy may develop only later, particularly when the
				narcolepsy begins, in children. The cataplexy does not respond as
				well to Modafinil and requires often something else, e.g. oxybate
				or tricycles or venlafaxine. Some patients try to avoid emotional
				situations and these may require prophylaxis.
				<p align="left">Almost invariably cataplexy is associated with narcolepsy.
				Cataplexy without narcolepsy is rare and the cause is unknown.
				Even in a collapse, people are usually able to avoid injury
				because they learn to notice the feeling of the cataplectic attack
				approaching and the fall is usually slow and progressive. In
				children, cataplexy and muscle weakness episodes triggered by
				emotions such as laughing and joking are often atypical. They
				may be without triggers and affect the face with mouth opening,
				tongue protrusion. This might occur often with very abrupt
				sleepiness and weight gain.
				<p align="left">As in REM sleep, the person continues to breathe and is able to
				control eye movements [32].
				<p align="left">Cataplexy presence is almost diagnostic clinically for
				narcolepsy, yet I have seen a patient with definite cataplexy
				expressing the HLA DQB1 06:02 gene but with no classical
				daytime sleepiness, but severe chronic fatigue instead. It could
				be argued that the daytime sleepiness will come but the fatigue
				severity in the absence of other conditions is notable.
				This would be an example of the value of using a standard
				clinical measure. The best way is applying a standardized
				questionnaire, such as The Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire
				(NNQ) [23-25]. These are discussed later.
				
				<h3>Accessory features</h3>
				<p align="left">Sleep paralysis is regarded as associated with REM sleep
				atonia intruding into wakefulness. This produces impaired
				maintenance of REM sleep atonia and might manifest with dream
				imagery intruding into wakefulness [33] at the start of sleep (e.g.
				hypnagogic hallucinations) and on awakening (hypnopompic
				hallucinations). In my opinion, these are often visual and
				sometimes illusory phenomena, but not hallucinations themselves
				as they are distortions, not images seen or voices that are heard
				without any sensory stimulation so the term "hallucination" may
				be inaccurate sometimes.
				<h3>Associated features</h3>
				<p align="left">Attention to periodic leg movements (PLM), sleep apnea and
				REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is particularly important in
				the management of the older narcoleptic patient, in whom these
				conditions are more likely to occur [33].
				
		<h1 id="differentiating">Differentiating Fatigue and Sleepiness. Part 3</h1>
		
				<p align="left">Fatigue is a general term which refers to any of exhaustion,
				tiredness, weariness, drowsiness, low energy, sleepiness during the
				day when you are supposed to be awake.
				<p align="left">At the PNI, we have used the PNI Fatigue Severity Scale
				(FISS) for about 2 decades and found it useful. It is a self-scored
				evaluation of fatigue designed to differentiate from clinical
				depression, as both share fatigue symptoms. However, it's also
				particularly useful as well in narcoleptics to differentiate from
				sleep apnea and other dyssomnias. We actually use it as part of
				a series of 10 tests that we call the Diagnostic-Screen 10. The
				Epworth is another one of these ten tests.
				<p align="left">The ratings for the PNI Fatigue Severity Scale (FISS) are based
				on a 0 to 6 scale (our PNI scoring system) scored over the last
				week.
				<p align="left">There are two tests.
				<p align="left">The FISS-1 previously just the Fatigue Severity Scale (FISS)
				contains 9 items so the minimum score is 0 and maximum is 6.
				Range is therefore 0 from 54.
				<p align="left">Scoring 10 or above is significant. 19 or above reflects
				problems.
				<p align="left">The FISS-1 first item is different My motivation is lower when
				I an fatigued is scored as a subset decimal point.
				<p align="left">Reference is http://www.mult-sclerosis.org/
				fatigueseverityscale.html but this scale uses a 1-7 range. This
				was the only test we used till 2012.
				<p align="left">In 2012, the PNI added an accessory 5 point scale-the FISS-2
				was added. This was based on feedback from patients and it could
				be regarded as the activation component. We sometimes combine
				the scores. This adds 30 more points to the score. We separate
				the FISS-1 which is the official score, from the FISS-2 which is the
				extra item score. Our preliminary impression is the FISS-2 might
				correlate better with features such excessive daytime sleepiness,
				and also motivational features particularly on awakening. But this
				needs to be properly analyzed.
				<p align="left">Surprisingly, I could not find studies of FISS (here the FISS-
				1) with ESS. Yet it is logical because patients with many causes
				for fatigue (systemic e.g., anemia, cardiac, renal, hepatic, Lyme
				disease; brain related e.g. sleep apnea; psychiatric e.g. depression,
				anxiety; general e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome) should have their
				higher FISS scores correlated with the ESS to measure comparative
				daytime sleepiness. The initial clue for going towards the NNQ
				is when ESS scores are >11 for narcolepsy daytime sleepiness
				and also fatigue is only mildly elevated (averaging 1 or 2 per
				item) as opposed to very high. We have found this clue valuable.
				As indicated, now, it looks like a relatively high FISS-2 score
				compared with FISS-1 may also provide an excellent clue to other
				ongoing investigations. With any of these clues being abnormally
				high, we then do the Narcolepsy gene blood screen.
				<p align="left">There are other approaches as well. For example, The Sustained
				Attention to Response Task is a valid and easy-to-administer
				measure to assess treatment effects in narcolepsy, enhanced by
				combining it with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [21].

				don't describe what they're using.
				<p align="left">We have scored based on 0 to 3 scores with 0= never, 1=
				slight, 2= moderate, 3= high chance of dozing. The original scale
				Statistical analysis is much easier when looking at 0 to 3, and this
				also helps "eyeball" results quickly.
				<p align="left">However, we wanted to have a broader severity indication.
				Therefore we modified the ESS:
				<p align="left">All our scoring is 0 for never and applies a 0 to 4 so we apply a
				5-point scale. Range therefore 0 to 24. We still obtain two scores
				so our data can be compared with others using the ESS 0-3 scale.
				Scores of 5 or above are clinically relevant. Scores of 8 to 10
				reflect major symptoms.

				<p align="left">The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score calculates the presence
				of residual sleepiness. The key series of questions are: "Under
				normal circumstances, how likely are you to doze off or fall asleep
				in the following situations, in contrast to just feeling tired? Even
				if you have not done some of these things recently, try to imagine
				how they would affect you. Use the following scale to choose the
				most appropriate number for each situation."

				<p align="left">For statistical reasons, we obtain the 2 scores (based on the
				original 4 point scale of 0-3) MESS R3 and the MESS R4 score
				based on the later 5 point scale (0-4).
				<p align="left">The data in the literature is exclusively the 4 point scale with a
				maximum of 8*3= 24.
				
				<p align="left">It is here that scores of 11 or 12 are suggestive for narcolepsy
				particularly if the FISS-1 fatigue score is not very high (e.g. <20).
				But given that a score of 4 is relatively rare, and would most
				commonly push the items below 11 or 12, we could technically
				use MESS R4 in any event.
				<p align="left">The MESS and FISS gives us the clue to ask the patient to
				complete the NNQ below, and whenever we do this for the first
				time, we perform HLA testing for narcolepsy.
				<p align="left">These clinical tools help prioritize individuals with the most
				severe illness regarding whom we should prescribe medication
				for. They are not perfect but at least standardized for each patient.
				We consider polysomnography (PSG) but it is rare for this to be
				needed because more than 90% of our patients are clear-cut.
				Additionally, the modern media facilitate reaching out to the
				general population to raise awareness of the other conditions
				associated with EDS such as sleep apnea [34].
				<p align="left">And it is this combination, Narcolepsy plus Sleep Apnea, that
				we see quite frequently.
				<p align="left">We return to the ESS: There are over a hundred peer reviews
				publications on the Epworth in many countries, and translated
				into several languages.
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>1. There is good agreement on all the items totaled together
				between the patients and their close relatives, but not always
				within individual items.
				<LI>2. The correlation of objective sleepiness as measured by the
				ESS and the close relatives is high, and this also correlates
				on MSLT [35].
				<LI>3. The cut-off for EDS (MESS >10 points) was chosen in line
				with the traditional ESS.
				<LI>4. Data scores before and after interventions correlated with
				improvement in predicting OSA in patients with COPD [36].
				<LI>5. ESS answers differ according to sociocultural and economic
				conditions. For example, a score of 8 or higher on the ESS
				would seem a more appropriate cutoff score than 10 or 11,
				that many others use, to suspect clinically relevant sleepiness
				in the Turkish population [37].
				<LI>6. Men and women reported similar degree of subjective
				sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale,
				though women demonstrated significantly more severe
				objective sleepiness on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT)
				[11].
				<LI>7. Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores appear to be an indication
				of personal sleep debt that varies depending on one's
				individual sleep requirement [38].
				<LI>8. Interestingly, ESS scores were considerably more sensitive
				than MSLT scores in documenting efficacy of the most
				common treatment, modafinil [20] (and presumably, it
				would be the same for its very close cousin, armodafinil).
				On the other hand, the improvements in MSLT scores were
				minimal and remained in the pathologically sleepy range
				[20]. These findings suggest that the ESS is a more sensitive
				and clinically meaningful tool to evaluate the efficacy of
				modafinil in narcolepsy [20].
				<LI>9. By measuring a clinically useful and well-used fatigue
				scale, the FISS-1, we are able to better gauge the relevance
				of the patient's sleepiness at a clinical level. Although we
				have added the FISS-2 to it, and cannot officially analyze it
				because there is no other standard for these questions, we
				have found that it is clinically useful appreciating the success
				of the interventions because the real world seldom contains
				a single individual diagnosis.</td></tr></table>

		<h1 id="nnq">The Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire (NNQ): Part 4</h1>
				
				<h3>The Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire (NNQ)</h3>
				<p align="left">The Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire is a copyrighted
				screening questionnaire [25]. This developed out of necessity
				because as far as we're aware there is now equivalent.
				<p align="left">It was needed in the running of the Pacific Neuropsychiatric
				Institute (PNI), as it would be for any Neuropsychiatric Institute.
				Vernon Neppe authored an early version of this test in the
				1982 while working in a Sleep-Wake Lab at the Division of
				Chronobiology, Cornell University, NY. Dr Neppe then adapted it
				in the early 1990s. This has become critically important because
				there remains no test to screen for possible narcoleptic symptoms
				[23]. Recently, Dr Neppe updated the NNQ (2016) to include
				the latest criteria and ideas on narcolepsy and cataplexy. These
				were purely additions, with no subtractions so that our previous
				dataset remains.
				<p align="left">We have used the Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire (NNQ)
				at the PNI in Seattle, WA [25] as a screen in every patient who
				exhibits any clues to narcolepsy, significant day time sleepiness
				on the modified PNI Modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale (MESS)
				or disproportionate sleepiness compared with fatigue on the
				modified PNI Fatigue Severity Scale Questionnaire (FISS).

				testing (which is a simple blood test).
				<LI>Table 4A: Why is the Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire used? [23,25].</td></tr></table>
				
				<p align="left">The NNQ has been used regularly clinically (at the PNI)
				since 1992 for all patients in which the diagnosis of Narcolepsy
				or a narcoleptic syndrome is queried.
				Patients complete this open answer questionnaire in
				Microsoft Word. The numbers of questions per item have
				changed over time including 2014 and 2016. The patients
				usually complete this in a short w hile (such as a hour0.
				<p align="left">The NNQ covers the areas of:
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>a) Nocturnal sleep (20 was 12 items),
				<LI>b) Day-time sleepiness (34 was15 items plus subitems),
				<LI>c) Cataplexy (20 was 10 items),
				<LI>d) Sleep paralysis (13 was 9+ items),
				<LI>e) Special Tests (new only: subitems),
				<LI>f ) Diplopia (18 was 5 items).</td></tr></table>
				<p align="left">There are several extra items:
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>a) Automatic Behavior (32 was 16 items with subitems),
				<LI>b) Perceptions (33 was 20+ items), Dreams (24 was18+
				items),
				<LI>c) Nocturnal Sleep Disorders (11 was 12 items) and
				<LI>d) Ego-Boundaries (23 was 12 items with subitems).</td></tr></table>
				<p align="left">We cannot present comparative data because there is no
				other questionnaire. But it has proven extremely sensitive
				and specific in screening for symptoms of Narcolepsy based
				on measures of diagnosis and also of clinical response to
				medication. (In twenty years we have not had patients where
				eventually we prescribed wakefulness agents and found the
				patients did not respond as expected. On the other hand we
				did not use these agents when not indicated, and managed
				with alternative medications. We can therefore argue that the
				use of the NNQ is pr oven.
				<p align="left">In practice, the NNQ has always been combined with the
				HLA Narcolepsy screen and HLA-DS15 (DRB1*15), HLADQ6
				(DQA1*0102/DQB1*0602). This has proven useful in
				supporting our expectations (clinical hypotheses) that the
				NNQ is valuable. As a point of interest, at the PNI, we might see
				more narcolepsy than anywhere else in WA state. Consequently,
				we have over the past two plus decades had the opportunity to
				see many variants. At times we see more patients because of
				loaded family histories. Our comments here are based on this
				experience.
				<p align="left">The NNQ together with HLA have proven very useful.
				The utility is well documented on response to appropriate
				medications particularly wakefulness agents, such as
				Modafinil. Usage of these criteria differentiates two groups:
				A Narcolepsy diagnostic group and a Primary Dyssomnia
				(without Narcolepsy) syndrome.
				<p align="left">Interestingly, a high proportion of these patients has
				temporolimbic instability and also r equire anticonvulsants.
				I provide below the key aspects of the NNQ. Those wishing
				to use it in research or clinically should contact us at admin@
				pni.org.

		<h1 id="genetics">The Genetics of Narcolepsy: Part 5</h1>
				<p align="left">No gold standard currently exists for the diagnosis of
				narcolepsy. Conventional diagnostic criteria have often been
				unwieldy, requiring low CSF orexin (same as "hypocretin"),
				or 2 positive SORMPS out of 4 or 5 or 6 under strict MSLT
				conditions. The criteria are often arbitrary and varies. Yet,
				in research, defined criteria for case selection are needed to
				compare the results of different studies [3]. Even more so real
				interpretation is required clinically.
				<p align="left">Most importantly, it seems that based on the data available,
				we can ensure a diagnosis of narcolepsy that is appropriate
				in the high 90% range. This can be easily done by clinically
				applying careful evaluations and structured questionnaires.
				This allows making sure the patient's day-time sleepiness
				conforms to the narcolepsy label, that the patient has cataplexy
				features which makes the diagnosis more specific, and that the
				patient expresses HLA DQB1*0602. If this happens, and this
				triad of features based on research occurs in some 85% of
				cases, we can be reasonably certain that the patient will also
				have a CSF hypocretin/ orexin deficiency. We will therefore
				know the cause biologically is due to the disease state of
				narcolepsy. This data is not new, but has been known since
				2002 [3].
				<p align="left">MSLT may be valuable in the small proportion of patients
				who fail in this assessment: this will include either or both
				of narcolepsy without cataplexy, or those who do not express
				HLA DQB1*0602, but they might even include those who on
				CSF do not have a hypocretin state. I humbly submit that at
				this point, these exceptions are at best unproven entities
				and that biologically they might not be narcoleptic and may
				reflect more than one condition or subtype. Yet, we don't have
				studies, at this point, proving different conditions or subtypes.
				<p align="left">Let's look at the information available on the HLA gene. We
				know that:
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>i) Even as long ago as 2002, new research diagnostic
				criteria for narcolepsy were based on HLA typing. These
				possessed high interrater reliability and appeared
				valid descriptors of the syndrome. These results may
				be useful in providing consistent criteria to compare
				different research studies [3]. Why?
				<li>ii) The key, most common gene involved in narcolepsy is
				HLA DQB1*0602: depending on the study, about seven
				eighths [39] or even 12/13 [1] of cataplexy patients,
				but only 33% of those with narcolepsy features
				without cataplexy, express the gene [3]. The question
				is: Are these figures of the those who do not express
				the correct HLA gene reflecting poor clinical diagnoses
				and not representing narcolepsy, or are they accurate?
				Clinically, this is unanswered completely, but they
				likely accurately reflect different diagnoses based on
				rankings of narcolepsy diagnoses [3]. Why?
				<li>iii) The HLA-DQB1*02 frequency is also increased in the
				population with hypersomnia when compared with
				the control population (p = 0.004) But enough with
				hypersomnia without narcolepsy are positive that we
				need other tests. This means effectively that the *0602
				expression reveals potentially more than narcolepsy
				and therefore that it may encompass any dyssomnia.
				My own impression is that if one is very careful in a
				neuropsychiatric population: We have found that even
				those "controls" who express *0602 have, in every
				case, expressed some kind of sleep disturbance. A 34%
				figure of "controls" from this study [40]. is the highest
				in the literature [3] with 16% being a more common
				estimate [40], and there may even be only 10% or less
				so-called false positives depending on the population
				[23]. I argue that the difference is an epidemiological
				one, depending on how skewed and symptomatic the
				population is. But, I humbly submit that we could
				be talking about the far more common "primary
				narcolepsy", with the usual gene expression, and if
				tested this would imply low orexin and likely autoimmune
				components, and "symptomatic narcolepsy",
				with secondary brain damage at the hypothalamic RAS
				level. This can manifest in many ways: I've even seen a
				case mobilized by cysticercosis.
				<li>iv) The evidence is so strong that if DQB1*06:02 is
				positive, subjects are at a 251-fold increase in risk for
				narcolepsy [41]! An overwhelming portion of genetic
				risk for narcolepsy with cataplexy is found at this DQB1
				locus [41], but importantly other loci such as DQA may
				also be relevant and therefore tests should be for both
				loci, particularly as expression at both loci might show
				higher penetrance of symptoms.
				v) Without HLA-DQB1*02 expression, it is very unlikely
				that narcolepsy exists [40]. My impression is that,
				yes, narcoleptic syndrome could exist but this is due
				to possible damage to the Orexin or hypothalamoreticulo-
				activating system dysfunction due to trauma,
				tumor or infection. So the absence of genes does not
				then exclude narcolepsy, but the clinical situation must
				provide much stronger evidence.
				<li>vi) We generally need not demonstrate low CSF
				hypocretin-1 levels. This is because we know, based
				on other research, that low hypocretin will likely
				be present in about 85% of cases with DQB1*06:02
				expression and cataplexy. However, if the patient does
				not have cataplexy, only about one fifth of such patients
				will have low CSF hypocretin-1 levels: This is a curiosity,
				because cataplexy sometimes takes some years to
				develop after the narcolepsy day time sleepiness. This
				might mean that the low CSF hypocretin-1 levels are
				not primary but secondary to progression of the illness.
				<li>vii) However, rare cases (about one in sixty) are
				DQB1*06:02 negative with low CSF hypocretin-1. These
				occur equally with or without cataplexy: Therefore,
				even hypocretin does not correlate fully. There are
				rare HLA negative subjects with severe cataplexy, but
				often without clear triggers [39]. This might suggest
				that another gene could be involved, so we need to look
				further here.
				<li>viii) Although HLA-DQB1*06:02 is the strongest
				predisposing genetic factor for narcolepsy, the effect
				of this gene must therefore be considered alongside
				that of others, and that turns out to be its polymorphic
				partner, DQA1 [39].
				<li>ix) HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele with narcolepsy and cataplexy
				is clearly a major predictor of cataplexy in narcoleptic
				patients. We argue that the literatures' supports it
				could be used as an additional diagnostic marker
				alongside Hypocretin [42]. This may seem obvious but
				bears mention because the literature seldom points
				this out.
				<li>x) The genetic basis for narcolepsy may also be linked
				increased susceptibility to infectious factors or an
				immune cytotoxic mechanism in narcolepsy, potentially
				targeting hypocretin neurons: this may be linked not
				only with DQB1 gene but DQ A [43].
				<li>xi) A secondary HLA-DP association may be present
				in rare cases representing particularly difficult
				diagnostic challenges: The rare subtype DPB1*0901,
				and homologous DPB1*10:01 subtype [39]. However,
				it does point out that occasionally there are other ways
				of narcolepsy expression.
				<li>xii) The HLA-DQB1*06:02 involves a functional HLADQ
				molecule consists of a DQ alpha and a DQ beta
				chain. The HLA-DQB1*06:02 (DQ beta) has a strong
				preference for binding to HLA-DQA1*01:02 (DQ alpha
				), and together they form the functional DQ0602 dimer
				[44].
				<li>xiii) In individuals homozygous for HLA-DQB1*06:02-
				DQA1*01:02, a dosage effect would be expected if the
				HLA-DQ0602 dimer itself is directly involved in the
				etiology. This does occur. An increased expression
				of the HLA-DQ0602 dimer is expected in individuals
				homozygous for HLA-DQB1*06:02-DQA1*01:02, but is
				also hypothesized in individuals heterozygous for HLADQB1*
				06:02 and homozygous for HLA-DQA1*01:02. A
				Dutch study showed importantly, a significantly higher
				prevalence of homozygosity for DQA1*01:02 was found
				in HLA-DQB1*06:02 heterozygous patients compared
				to controls (O.R. 2.37, p < 0.001). The latter finding
				clearly supports a direct role of the HLA-DQ molecule
				in the development of disease. 44 It also suggests
				that all studies should include DQA1*01:02 as well as
				DQB1*06:02. This is supported by other genetic studies
				[45].
				<li>xiv) HLA genes likely function under an incomplete
				penetrance model, with possible influences from
				environmental factors or other genes different to HLA
				genes [46]. This may explain why patients from the
				same family, and with the same main gene expressions
				like 0602, still vary markedly in symptoms. 46 At least
				some of these patients have markedly loaded family
				histories and autosomal dominant inheritance is likely
				[47-49].
				<li>xv) Few sleep disorders have an established genetic basis
				including four rare diseases that may result from a
				single gene mutation: fatal familial insomnia, familial
				advanced sleep-phase syndrome, chronic primary
				insomnia, and narcolepsy with cataplexy. However, most
				sleep disorders are complex in terms of their genetic
				susceptibility together with the variable expressivity
				of the phenotype even within a same family [50]. The
				extent of penetrance of genes is pertinent her e.
				<li>xvi) Finally, reanalyzing the genes, it may be even more
				complex. There may be protective genes based on
				Chinese work. HLA-DPA1(*)01:03-DPB1(*)04:02
				(DP0402; [51]. They also found an independent
				predisposing effect of DQB1*03:01 predisposes
				via a currently unknown mechanism which might
				explain the few that are not due to the 06:02 gene.
				They also reported strong protective effects of
				HLA-DPA1(*)01:03-DPB1(*)04:02 (DP0402 and
				HLA-DPA1(*)01:03-DPB1(*)04:01 (DP0401 and
				predisposing effects of HLA-DPB1(*)05:01 [52]. It is
				clear that both DQA1 and DQB1 influence narcolepsy
				risk [51,52].
				<li>xvii) Moreover, genome wide association studies have
				subsequently been able to prove that autoimmune
				mechanisms are responsible for the manifestation of
				narcolepsy with the HLA association being the most
				important for susceptibility and protection [10].
				<li>xviii) Unlike the case of canine narcolepsy, where mutations
				in the hypocretin (orexin) neuropeptide precursor
				(HCRT) receptor have been found, it has been argued
				that Orexin deficiency is the cause of human narcolepsy
				[31,53]. The recent advances in the elucidation of the
				genetics of canine narcolepsy and the pathophysiologic
				role of hypocretin, in animals and humans, enhances
				current diagnostic capability and will ultimately
				provide better treatment modalities in the future [27],
				as well as clarify etiological and diagnostic issues.
				<li>xix) Data also suggests that narcolepsy may be the result of
				an autoimmune reaction triggered by H1N1 vaccination
				in susceptible individuals [54].
				<li>xx) Given these differences, and the above data, it might
				support the possibility of HLA genes and associated
				receptor expressions being fundamental.
				xxi) Moreover, Mignot's analysis could explain increased
				disease heterogeneity in a non-cataplexy group and a
				direct effect of the HLA DQB1*0602 genotype on the
				clinical expression of narcolepsy supports this [55].
				xxii) Based on this data, it appears that the gene expression
				may be even more basic than the low orexin / hypocretin
				levels which may be secondary: This is a new Neppe
				hypothesis using this data. Effectively, the current
				idea has been that hypocretin deficiency causes the
				narcolepsy. I propose that based on the HLA data the
				cause is higher up the stream, and orexin deficiency is a
				consequence, albeit an early consequence downstream,
				but not a cause. A way to test this is to find patients
				with HLA DQB1 * 06-02 gene expression, with any early
				symptoms of narcolepsy, but which has normal orexin,
				and then with progression, later deficient orexin.

		<h1 id="management">Management of narcolepsy: Part 6</h1>
				<p align="left">Two conditions are treated in narcolepsy.
				<p align="left">The first is day-time sleepiness.
				<p align="left">Current treatment recommendations suggest that these
				wakefulness drugs (also called wakefulness-promoting agent
				or eugeroics) should be used as a first-line treatment ahead
				of conventional stimulants such methylphenidate or sodium
				oxybate [56].
				<p align="left">The advent of modafinil (Provigil in USA) and armodafinil
				(Nuvigil in USA) (it's daughter effectively with a longer
				half-life allowing daily not BID management at times) has
				revolutionized management of narcolepsy [57]. It is indicated
				for narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and excessive
				daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea
				[58]. It is not indicat ed in cataplexy.
				<p align="left">Modafinil and Armodafinil is a schedule IV controlled
				substance with restricted availability and usage in the USA,
				though in many countries it is a prescription drug, but not
				further controlled.
				<p align="left">Although the mechanism of action of modafinil and
				armodafinil was initially unknown, we do know it does act
				as a selective, relatively weak, atypical dopamine reuptake
				inhibitor, possibly as a dopamine transporter reuptake
				inhibitor [57].
				<p align="left">Modafinil produces wakefulness reportedly without the
				need for compensatory sleep, and shows a relatively low, if any
				[59], potential for abuse, through mechanisms e.g. cholinergic
				may be pertinent.
				<p align="left">What is useful in follow up is the ability of sleep-stage
				sequencing of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods in the
				multiple sleep latency test to predict treatment response, in
				narcolepsy, with cataplexy or without, applying clinical and
				polysomnographic criteria. This can be used in monitoring
				response to medications [56]. However, as indicated, the
				Epworth Sleepiness Scale appears more effective when using
				modafinil in narcolepsy [20] and also in obstructive sleep
				apnea [36].
				<p align="left">The second medication approach is in the management of
				the Cataplexy.
				<p align="left">Sodium oxybate and gamma-hydroxybutyrate has been
				found to be effective at reducing the number of cataplexy
				episodes. Sodium oxybate is generally safe and typically the
				recommended treatment for some clinicians as the most
				effective agent.
				<p align="left">Sodium oxybate (USAN) (Xyrem from Jazz Pharma USA)
				is designated as an orphan drug, a pharmaceutical drug
				developed specifically to treat an orphan disease, cataplexy
				and narcolepsy. It is FDA approved for the treatment
				of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with
				narcolepsy, and for the treatment of cataplexy associated with
				narcolepsy. and under the name Alcover, it is used in Italy for
				treatment of alcohol withdrawal and dependence. Therefore,
				it's the only drug marketed for narcolepsy EDS and cataplexy.
				It is generally well tolerated by most patients. The drug has
				been safely used by patients with narcolepsy since 2002, with
				surprising low rates of abuse, dependence, and withdrawal,
				and very rare sexual assault cases.
				<p align="left">The active metabolite of sodium oxybate, gammahydroxybutyric
				acid, acts as an agonist at the GABA-B receptor
				complex and the GHB receptor. This likely contributes to some
				part of sodium oxybate's therapeutic effects.
				<p align="left">However, it is a central nervous system depressant and
				must be taken exactly as prescribed. My biggest problem with
				oxybate is a practical one: patients must take it at night and
				wake in the night to take the second dose. A lesser irritation is
				simply that and patients should not eat for two hours before
				bedtime.
				<p align="left">Instead, my own preference is for tricyclic antidepressants.
				I have been using nortriptyline but others use imipramine,
				clomipramine or protriptyline; venlafaxine is possible,
				although it can be argued that the benefit is not as good. I have
				seen recommendations pertaining to SSRIs, but I have no proof
				all are effective, and if so that the effect will be maintained for
				prolonged periods. Because tricyclics have been available for
				up to 60 years, we know they do not appear to lose efficacy
				certainly in depression.
				<p align="left">These compounds work to manage both cataplexy and the
				REM sleep-onset symptoms of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic
				hallucinations.
				<h3>Non-pharmacological management</h3>
				<p align="left">Non-pharmacological management of narcolepsy is
				important: Patients should maintain a strict regular wakesleep
				schedule and good sleep hygiene. They should benefit
				from voluntary afternoon naps and a program of regular
				exercise [33]. Importantly, many cataplectics try to avoid
				highly emotionally charged situations such as laug hter.
				<p align="left">Treatment is highly individualized, depending on the
				severity of daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and sleep disruption.
				
				<h3>Nuggets</h3>
				<p align="left">Patients with narcolepsy should respond to modafinil or
				armodafinil. Dosage varies greatly.
				<p align="left">Patients with cataplexy need tricyclic antidepressants like
				nortriptyline in low to medium doses.
				<p align="left">atients with hypnagogic hallucinatory phenomena
				sometimes respond to small doses of atypical neuroleptics like
				aripiprazole 2mg to 5mg daily (but this is an out of label use).
				
		<h1 id="mechanisms">Mechanisms of Narcolepsy: Part 7</h1>
				<p align="left">The current postulated cause of narcolepsy is due to an
				autoimmune destruction of the neurotransmitter hypocretin,
				which regulates arousal and wakefulness. This leads to a
				low level of CSF hypocretin. We know further that damage
				to orexin-secreting neurons in the hypothalamus can lead to
				inhibition of motor neurons, thus lowering muscle tone.
				
				<h3>Cataplexy</h3>
				<p align="left">The neurological process behind the lesion of narcolepsy
				is the impairment of descending pathways controlling the
				normal inhibition of muscle tone, consequently, cataplexy
				results with muscle atonia [60].
				<p align="left">This loss of tonus is caused by massive inhibition of motor
				neurons in the spinal cord. When this happens during waking,
				the victims of cataplectic attacks lose control of their muscles.
				However, even though it is not apparent, muscle tone
				paralysis occurs at inappropriate times, but, nevertheless, the
				patient still continues to breathe and is able to control eye
				movements [61]. This is postulated and likely to be because
				this phenomenon is linked with Rapid Eye Movement (REM)
				sleep.
				<p align="left">The hypothalamus region of the brain regulates basic
				functions of hormone release, emotional expression and
				sleep. The absence of neuro-excitatory properties of the
				hypothalamic hypocretin-peptidergic system 33 appears
				linked with the neurochemical hypocretin (Orexin), which is
				regulated by the hypothalamus. Hypocretin is significantly
				reduced in almost all patients with the symptoms of cataplexy,
				and is the primary chemical important in regulating sleep and
				states of arousal. Hypocretin deficiency is further associated
				with decreased levels of histamine and epinephrine, which are
				chemicals important in promoting wakefulness, arousal and
				alertness.
				<p align="left">Substitution of the deficient neuropeptides by hypocretin
				agonists [62] is a possible causal treatment strategy if this
				is, indeed, the etiology, or even if this is an early result of
				cataplexy and EDS.
				
				<h3>The Reticular Activating System</h3>
				<p align="left">The reticular activating system involves up and down
				stimulations [63].
				<p align="left">The muscular paralysis can be perceived as the reverse
				effect of the sleepiness. The Reticular Activating System (RAS)
				goes to sleep in the other direction at an inappropriate timeso
				to say when RAS phenomena occur upwards. When this
				upward component happens during waking, we argue that the
				patient falls asleep and the kind of firing results in rapid-eyemovement
				sleep almost immediately with or without stage 1
				sleep.
				<p align="left">When the downward component happens during waking,
				the patient with a cataplectic attack loses control of some of
				their muscles [32,63]. This loss of tone is caused by massive or
				limited inhibition of motor neurons in the spinal cord.
				
				<h3>Hypocretin Deficiency</h3>
				<p align="left">Hypocretin levels can be measured using cerebrospinal
				fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity values: Deficiency
				is currently regarded as a level of less than or equal to onethird
				of values obtained in healthy subjects tested using the
				same assay, and this usually works out to less than or equal to
				110 pg/mL. Nevertheless, some argue that the optimal cutoff of
				CSF hypocretin-1 for narcolepsy without cataplexy diagnosis
				should be as high as 200 pg/ml rather than 110 pg/ml. [64].
				A limitation is that CSF levels of hypocretin-1 should not be
				assessed in the context of acute brain injury, inflammation, or
				infection.
				<p align="left">Patients with narcolepsy possess a reduced number of
				hypocretin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus and
				accordingly the hypocretin level in the cerebrospinal fluid is
				low [10].
				<p align="left">Anatomically, hypocretinergic axons make asymmetric
				synapses with neurons within the locus cerulean, ventral
				tegmental area, dorsal raphe nucleus and laterodorsal
				tegmental nucleus that target the medial frontal cortex.
				Hypocretins could facilitate wakefulness and cortical
				activation, therefore, by activation of those neurons with
				cortical projections in these four reticular nuclei [65].
				<p align="left">The neuropeptide hypocretin (orexin) has functions, such
				as the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, the autonomous
				nerve system, motor system and metabolic processes [10].
				<p align="left">Imaging studies have revealed neurodegenerative changes,
				making a multifactorial etiopathogenesis probable. The
				frequent occurrence of metabolic disorders has not yet been
				clarified. 10 And certainly puzzling are those few cases with
				normal hypocretin levels in the CSF. Does this imply a second
				process such as resistance to the receptor, or another cause,
				or as indicated, that the hypocretin deficiency certainly is
				an important result, but minimally downstream and not the
				primary etiology.
				<p align="left">How do low hypocretin patients compare with normal
				hypocretin measures on NPSG and MSLT? These patients
				have far more frequent short rapid-eye movement (REM)
				sleep latency during polysomnography, as well as shorter
				sleep latencies and more sleep-onset REM periods during the
				Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) [64].
				<p align="left">In essence, current thinking is that measuring CSF
				hypocretin-1 is a definitive diagnostic test, provided that it
				is interpreted within the clinical context [66]. It has limited
				use when the MSLT is difficult to interpret as in subjects who
				are already treated with psychoactive drugs or with other
				concurrent sleep disorders [66].
				
				<h3>Nugget</h3>
				<p align="left">The question is "how far down in the narcolepsy cycle is the
				orexin data"? A small proportion of cataplectics have normal
				orexin levels yet express abnormal DQB genes [67]. Could it be
				that the damage is reflecting hypothalamic abnormalities and,
				as seen in the HLA discussion, based on this data, it appears
				that the gene expression may be even more basic than the
				slightly downstream low orexin / hypocretin levels, which
				then may be secondary? In this paper, I have suggested this as
				a feasible and possible new hypothesis, because the HLA data
				as a whole supports this line of reasoning.
				
		<h1 id="mslt">Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT): Part 8</h1>
				<p align="left">The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) test has become a
				routinely recommended evaluation to be performed in Sleep
				Labs for the diagnosis of nar colepsy [68].
				<p align="left">Without doubt, the test has some strong virtues in assisting
				difficult diagnoses and in monitoring changes after treatment,
				but that must be put in a perspective.
				<p align="left">In essence, there are some major difficulties, as well, about
				performing the MSLT:
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>a. first, the test works out as very expensive;

				<LI>h. combined with HLA testing of both the DQ-B and DQ-A
				series, and
				<LI>i. monitoring pharmacological response is usually adequate.
				<LI>j. Only then, if there are questions, the MSLT should be
				performed, with or without CSF Orexin (Hypocretin)
				levels.</td></tr></table>
				<p align="left">The problem might be more complex. MSLT is expensive,
				and when narcolepsy is diagnosed or suspected, but MSLT does
				not prove the condition, then often the insurance companies
				will not approve the costs of wakefulness drugs treatment,
				which on an extended lifetime basis, using today's prices, is
				extraordinarily expensive. If this happens, patients may not be
				able to afford their treatment and they might deteriorate, be
				unable to work, have disruptive family lives, and suffer a great
				deal and compromise their families. And therefore, if they
				have a narcolepsy diagnosis, and are already responding to
				modafinil or armodafinil, this creates a major risk for them, as
				their medical record might say that they do not have a positive
				MSLT. That is potentially tragic.
				<p align="left">In other words, I argue that there must another acceptable
				route for the medical insurances in the USA, certainly, to
				approve what the treating physicians regard as appropriate
				diagnoses of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, when
				these patients have been evaluated even without MSLT. That
				acceptable route should be clinical and scoring data e.g.
				Epworth, plus NNQ or other historical standard protocol, plus
				expression of HLA-DQB-0602.
				<p align="left">The problem may be more insidious. Why not just get an
				MSLT even though the diagnosis is relatively certain, including
				marked family histories? The difficulty is the "normal" MSLT
				result because at that point the patient who merits treatment
				on the basis of the previous narcolepsy evaluation (as listed in
				the sixth point above) may be denied costly pharmacological
				interventions by the medical insurances, and may not be able
				to afford the medications. This can be catastrophic for their
				future. Sadly, we personally have seen this happening on a
				number of occasions, and see as this as very tragic: Patients
				have literally lost their livelihood because they could not work
				and the insurances would not approve what for them are lifesaving
				medications.
				<p align="left">Additionally, as Mayer points out, the MSLT is a poor gold
				standard [69].
				<p align="left">Effectively, the ICSD-4 is, in any event, easily applicable
				in cases with typical cataplexy and narcolepsy where with
				the MSLT, further evaluations are almost always positive and
				may thus not always be needed [1]. The main conundrum lies
				with patients without cataplexy who are difficult to classify
				[1]. These patients' results might demonstrate difficulties in
				interpreting the MSLT, particularly in the presence of sleep
				apnea or reduced sleep.
				<p align="left">Let's briefly examine the utility of the Multiple Sleep
				Latency Test (MSLT).
				<p align="left">The most common criteria used is a multiple sleep latency
				test involves examining for Sleep Onset Rapid Eye Movement
				periods (SOREMPs). The MSLT test consists of four or five or
				even six 20-minute nap opportunities set two hours apart.
				The patient is monitored to measure the time elapsed from
				the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep and
				sleep latency. For a SOREMP to be positive, it should showing
				a mean sleep latency less than or equal to 8 minutes. For an
				MSLT there should be two or more SOREMPs. Technically,
				therefore, there should be two episodes of almost REM onset
				sleep for diagnosis or close to that, with up to a few minutes
				of a little stage 1 sleep beforehand, being acceptable. This
				criterion might be too stringent and diminish yield, but if
				there was only one SOREMP that might be too easy. This view
				is supported: Dauvilliers argues that the MSLT criteria indeed
				are too stringent certainly in the older population [8].
				An alternative that counts for one SOREMP in the American
				Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) classification, is a
				SOREMP (this time showing latency to rapid eye movement
				(REM) sleep of less than or equal to 15 minutes of sleep
				onset) on the preceding nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) and
				this may replace one of the SOREMPs on the MSLT. Nocturnal
				polysomnography (NPSG) sometimes precedes they multiple
				sleep latency testing (MSLT).
				<p align="left">The NPSG of a narcoleptic patient may be totally normal,
				or demonstrate the patient has a short nocturnal REM sleep
				latency (suggesting narcolepsy), or the patient may exhibit
				separate unexplained arousals or periodic leg movements
				[33].
				<p align="left">Based on sleep wave measurements, the diagnosis of
				narcolepsy is therefore supported by the presence of two or
				more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in the MSLT, or
				sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Let's re-examine this.
				Sansa et al examined the distribution of SOREMPs
				throughout the MSLT in narcolepsy with and without cataplexy.
				They applied the common five-nap test in MSLT, which requires
				at least two such tests to be positive. On average, about one
				fifth of these nap tests showed SORMPS and the fourth test in
				that sample was about a sixth. Shortening the MSLT to three
				or four naps decreased the capability of the test even more to
				support the diagnosis of nar colepsy [6].
				<p align="left">Sleep laboratory testing should be performed according
				to standard techniques, and results should be carefully
				interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical history in
				the presence of EDS. At least 1 week of Actigraphy assessment
				with a sleep log is strongly recommended prior to MSLT to
				determine factors that may bias results (e.g., insufficient sleep,
				shift work, or other circadian rhythm disorder). These reflect
				stringencies in the MSLT procedure (as behooves any logical
				test), for example, the patient should not have slept less than 6
				hours prior to MSLT, and the issues of medication will vary: for
				example, on what one is monitoring e.g. response to treatment
				is one parameter.
				<p align="left">Hypersomnolence and/or MSLT findings should not be
				better explained by other causes such as insufficient sleep,
				obstructive sleep apnea, delayed sleep phase disorder, or the
				effect of medication or substances or their withdr awal.
				On the other hand, in another study, patients with definitive
				orexin findings, and proven narcolepsy with cataplexy, have
				much higher sensitivity of 96% with specificity of 74%, whereas
				two SOREMPs had a sensitivity of 75%, with a specificity of
				95% for a pathological REM sleep propensity at MSLT. In this
				population, which likely does not require clinical selection at
				all because it is definitive, the multiple spontaneous SOREMPs
				during daytime clearly identified patients with narcolepsy
				[68].
				<p align="left">MSLT can also prognosticate: The presence of this specific
				sleep-stage sequence in all sleep-onset rapid eye movement
				periods was associated with worse treatment response and
				aid the prediction of treatment response in narcoleptics
				and provide a useful prognostic tool in clinical practice
				[56]. However, we could logically hypothesize that simply
				monitoring severity of clinical episodes e.g. by Epworth
				score, or the presence of HLA genes both DQA and DQB [46],
				or pharmacological response, might provide an even more
				adequate monitoring test, as well, but the research has not
				adequately explored that.
				<p align="left">These tests MSLT, Orexin, HLA are controversial in their
				interpretation: As I regard the literature currently including
				much of the research, routine MSLT is not required to prove
				diagnoses of narcolepsy when clinical (including structured
				histories) and HLA confirmation confirms the diagnosis of
				both narcolepsy and cataplexy. Technically, classifications
				have varied with what has been called Narcolepsy Type
				1 involving both excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and
				cataplexy as core features, and Narcolepsy Type 2 requiring
				the excessive daytime sleepiness as the essential feature but
				where cataplexy is absent. These criteria seem reasonable
				except one can say ""Narcolepsy with Cataplexy instead
				of Type 1, and "without Cataplexy" instead of Type 2. The
				problem comes when some classifications add additions such
				as MSLT and / or CST orexin as mandatory criteria: Those
				additions exclude most conditions from being either Type 1 or
				Type 2 because those tests have not been done. Additionally, if
				we examine the literature carefully, it is astonishing that HLA
				testing for narcolepsy has just been excluded in almost every
				list of fundamental criteria.
				<p align="left">Without cataplexy, MSLT for narcolepsy may be useful but
				should not be overvalued because it is not a gold standard, as
				in the real world there are often complicating features, such as
				additional obstructive sleep apnea.
				
		<h1 id="perspective">Perspective on Narcolepsy and Cataplexy: Part 9</h1>
				<p align="left">This final section is best illustrated with tables. First, I
				describe, again, the classical narcolepsy quartet where daytime
				sleepiness and cataplexy are far more important clinically
				than the other symptoms which may be non-specific and so
				not diagnostic and are difficult to conceptualize.
				
				<blockquote><p align="left">Day-time sleepiness: This involves uncontrolled sleepiness. Very commonly has a history of falling asleep
				while driving. After a 20 minute nap with or without remembered dreams, there is an episode of several
				hours of refractoriness during which the patient is very refreshed.
				<p align="left">Cataplexy: This loss of tone often occurs with high emotion. It can involve small groups of muscles and
				sometimes involves dropping objects, or the knees buckling. It can manifest with any group, but in our
				experience may be consistent for that individual. Cataplexy is very common and leads to a classification of
				Narcolepsy with cataplexy and Narcolepsy without cataplexy.
				<p align="left">Sleep paralysis: This is likely associated with the hypotonia in REM sleep with awakenings. The patient
				awakens from sleep during the night, was in a REM phase, and cannot move because he/she continues
				to be hypotonic. But respiration is ostensibly unaffected, and eye movements can occur, and males may
				be erectile. Patients should be reassured about the mechanism and that they are not safe during these
				episodes and not about to die, because such happenings otherwise could be very frightening.
				<p align="left">Hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena: Again, hypnagogic experiences may be linked up with the
				onset of REM prior to fully sleeping. I seldom encounter hypnopompic phenomena. These both are often
				predominantly visual, do not respond to atypical neuroleptic, and involve more distortions with illusions
				than hallucinations. The patient may have had them before, and education about them can take away the
				sense of fright, they may otherwise experience.
				<p align="left">Table 9A: Features of Narcolepsy: Classically there is a quartet.</blockquote>
				
				<p align="left">Next I describe features that are often not asked about.
				Double vision is again non-specific, but so is insomnia.
				However, the insomnia is a key symptom if patients are
				having narcoleptic sleepiness during the day, they must have
				insomnia. Therefore, treatment for insomnia at night with
				medications must be carefully considered.
				
				<BLOCKQUOTE><p align="left">Importantly, these are often not recognized.
				<p align="left">Diplopia: Double-vision is a common accessory symptom. But eye movements should be spared and this
				therefore should not be associated with cataplexy, so the symptom is strange [23,30,70,71].
				<p align="left">Nocturnal insomnia: This is very common and classically explained by the narcoleptic still having 7-8
				hour per day sleep cycles but their micro-sleeps during the day produce less need for sleep at night [23].
				<p align="left">Table 9B: Secondary features of narcolepsy.</blockquote>
				
				<p align="left">The difficulty with narcolepsy is the concurrent morbidity.
				<p align="left">Often the hallucinatory (usually visual) episodes or visual
				illusory distortions are misinterpreted. Patients are then
				given high doses of neuroleptic and get worse. Some end up in
				mental hospitals, sometimes for prolonged periods, because
				they get worse. And they are theoretically far more likely to
				be at higher risk then for tardive dyskinesia because they are
				biologically receiving inappropriate doses of neuroleptic for
				what are not true psychoses [14, 72-75].
				
				<BLOCKQUOTE><p align="left">
				Psychotic or psychopathological features: This occurs in about a quarter of patients and manifest
				differently from what one would expect. Narcolepsy is the great mimicker and we have several patients who
				were misdiagnosed and even may have ended up in mental hospitals [23].
				<p align="left">Primary Dyssomnia. Commonly we see patients with gene expression and often with a loaded family history,
				yet no history of narcoleptic symptoms. Yet, we have never seen a patient who has no sleep disturbance
				after taking a detailed history, and yet this genetic expression. This leads us to postulate that there is a
				gene positive, primary dyssomnia group who manifests extreme fatigue, yet still responds to wakefulness
				drugs. The genetic expression is, therefore. non-specific primary dyssomnia with narcolepsy as the primary
				condition, but never in our experience has the patient been entirely without sleep disturbance. But then we
				do not evaluate "normal" individuals, usually so this is a biased population! [23]
				<p align="left">Strange experiences: Though claimed otherwise, we have not seen more patients than the average
				population with out-of-body [76], near-death, or subjective paranormal experiences [23,77].

				<h3>Variants with gene expression</h3>
				<p align="left">
				<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0">
                <TR VALIGN="TOP"> <td><LI>a. About one third of our patients exhibit significant sleep
				disturbance. They may even have loaded family histories
				of narcolepsy (based on our experience and with the data
				available, this may be autosomal dominant). These patients
				might have significant primary sleep disturbances other
				than exhibiting narcolepsy. The gene then would reflect a
				dyssomnia, predominantly narcolepsy, but in these cases,
				other conditions.
				<LI>b. Some of our patients require a second hit (e.g. meningitis,
				in one instance, cysticercosis of the brain, head injury) to
				fully manifest.
				<LI>c. Many of our patients with narcolepsy but not cataplexy,
				have had MSLTs. However, they have had multiple sleep
				latency tests with a negative test. In our experience, and
				also at Cornell where I developed the NNQ in 1982-1983,
				it was not common to have a clean positive MSLT for
				narcolepsy, because patients' conditions are, in practice,
				complicated.

				wakefulness drug.
				<LI>b. Unlike the early literature that claimed that the
				electroencephalogram is invariably normal, about half
				our patients with narcolepsy have temporal lobe foci,
				or are loaded with temporal lobe symptomatology and
				respond to anticonvulsants, in addition.
				<LI>c. The psychopathology commonly is controlled by additive
				buspirone for the agitation and anxiety, and/or atypical
				neuroleptic in low doses such as aripiprazole for the
				psychotic or paranoid features.
				<LI>d. The cataplexy responds well to tricyclics such as
				nortriptyline or clomipramine (sometimes obsessionality
				is common).</td></tr></table>
				<p align="left">Finally I create Table 9D, effectively a flow chart to approach
				the possible narcoleptic patient.
				
				<blockquote><p align="left">Criteria sequence: Medical history taking then ESS + FISS, NNQ, HLA,
				responses, EEG if needed, MSLT and CSF unlikely unless atypical
				<br><b>1. Clinical symptoms</b>
				<br>a. Key features:
				<br>1. EDS (excessive day-time sleepiness)
				<br>2. Cataplexy
				<br>b. Accessory
				<br>Hypnagogic
				<br>Sleep paralysis
				<br>c. Extra likely
				<br>Diplopia
				<br>Insomnia
				<p align="left"><b>2. Clinical questionnaires to complete:</b>
				<br>PNI Fatigue Severity Scale. (FISS-M) with Modified Epworth
				Sleepiness Scale
				<br>If scores are on MESS are >10 (using the 8 questions 0 to
				3 range) or if the MESS score is half or more of the FISS-1, then the
				Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire is completed.
				<br>Neppe Narcolepsy Questionnaire (NNQ)
				<p align="left"><b>3. HLA measures</b>
				<br>Blood taken for narcolepsy HLA gene screening. It should include
				HLA DQB1* 0602 but also HLA DQA1*01:02 at minimum. If
				there are other issues, other HLA DQ protective genes should be
				prescribed. Supposedly the correlation of genetic HLA is in the
				90%+ range with cataplexy with DQB1*0602 alone. But there are
				other genes: HLA-DQ6 (DQA1*0102) appears important and others
				such as HLA-DS15 (DRB1*15).
				
				<p align="left"><b>4. Pharmacological responsiveness if the diagnosis is clear or
				very likely</b>
				<br>a. Modafinil and armodafinil are mainstream treatments
				(varying doses)
				<br>b. Methylphenidate or other stimulants if modafinil or
				armodafinil are not available and they are occasionally used
				as adjunct to them.
				<br>c. Xyrem (oxybate), unusually, is prescribed, simply because it
				requires awakening at night to take a dose. Xyrem when used
				appears effective, and then used on its own.
				<br>d. If cataplexy: Tricyclic antidepressant like nortriptyline e.g.
				50mg to 75mg daily.
				
				<p align="left"><b>5. The Limitations of Esoterica:</b>
				<br>a. CSF Orexin or Hypocretin: Very rarely needed because it will
				just confirm what I know unless questions about etiology.
				Useful in research though and might lead to new drug
				development.
				<br>b. MSLT and /or polysomnography: Useful in unusual cases, but
				expensive and low-yield in our group. But do not use this to
				decide whether wakefulness drugs are necessary.
				<br>c. Electroencephalograms. In our experience at the PNI over 20
				years, possibly one half of these patients have temporal lobe
				foci on extended monitoring. This contrasts with folk-lore
				where narcoleptic patients are supposed to have normal EEGs.
				If so the patients may require treatment e.g. Anticonvulsants.
				<br>Table 9D: The Practical Narcolepsy Ingredients (PNI).</blockquote>
				
				<p align="left">I clearly see a loaded population. But it is difficult for me
				to believe the incidence of Narcolepsy is only one in 5000
				patients. I suspect maybe 90% of narcoleptic patient diagnoses
				are missed and if so the likelihood is the incidence is closer
				to 1 in 500. This marked underestimation of the narcoleptic
				population is also an opinion shared by Manzaneda [31]
				and also by Chakravorty who argues that "only 15-30% of
				narcoleptic individuals are ever diagnosed or treated, and
				nearly half first present for diagnosis after the age of 40 y ears
				[33]."
				<h3>Applying the unified approach</h3>
				<p align="left">Classifications of old are a problem: Type 1 Narcolepsy
				of old is now Narcolepsy with Cataplexy. Type 2 Narcolepsy
				of old is now Narcolepsy without cataplexy. Fortunately, the
				Type 1 and Type 2 labeling seems to not be as fashionable. As
				indicated, I would argue for a primary narcolepsy condition
				and for one that is symptomatic narcolepsy due to other causes
				such as infection or tumor impacting hypothalamic function.
