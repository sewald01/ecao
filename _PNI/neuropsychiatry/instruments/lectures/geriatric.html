                          <H2>BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE BEHAVIORAL NEUROLOGICAL 
                            EXAMINATION</H2>
                          <P align="left"> The <I>neuropsychiatric mental status 
                            or behavioral neurological examination</I> interfaces 
                            between psychiatry and neurology. Its object is to 
                            evaluate global and focal functions of the cerebral 
                            cortex. Never to be neglected on the one side is evaluation 
                            of the patient's mental status at a psychiatric level 
                            - such features as appearance, consciousness, orientation, 
                            intelligence, cognitive functions, affect, motoric 
                            behavior, motivation, behavior in the ward, interpersonal 
                            relations, insight, judgment and dangerousness. </P>
                          <P align="left"> On the other hand, particular areas 
                            of interface in the neurological examination are: 
                            level of consciousness, attention span, memory, presence 
                            or absence of primitive reflexes such as grasp, pout, 
                            snout, palmar mental reflexes, Babinski signs, and 
                            basic evaluations of the patient's power and tone. 
                            Evaluations of the person's emotions and reaction 
                            to stress are also fundamental. </P>

                            mental status</I> of the patient is vital in any patient 
                            who may exhibit features of possible coarse neurobehavioral 
                            disease. One rapid but very inadequate method has 
                            involved the 30 point <I>Folstein Mini-Mental Status 
                            Examination </I>which is loaded with regard to orientation 
                            and memory items (15 out of 30), and which requires 
                            very substantial impairment, generally easily clinically 
                            diagnosed before the patient scores the 21-23 out 
                            of 30 or less generally perceived as clinically relevant. 
                            In addition, patients with depression may commonly 
                            not score near the 29 or 30 out of 30 expected in 
                            the non-demented. Consequently it is neither sensitive 
                            nor specific. </P>

                            B of the term BROCAS refers to <I>behavior</I>, and 
                            all facets of the Mental Status Examination are compared 
                            with the behavioral component. The ROCAS items are 
                            made up of two each of R-O-C-A-S: recall, recognition,

                          <P align="left"> <I>Organic mental disorders</I> are 
                            a class of disorders of mental functioning and behavior 
                            caused by transient or permanent dysfunction of the 
                            brain. As these disorders are a heterogeneous group, 
                            no single description can characterize them. The differences 
                            in clinical presentation reflect differences in localization, 
                            mode of onset, progression, duration and nature of 
                            underlying pathophysiological processes. There are 
                            a great many potential causes of cerebral dysfunction. 
                            The underlying cerebral disease or disorder may be 
                            primary, such as a brain tumor, or secondary to a 
                            systemic dysfunction. Organic mental disorders may 
                            occur at any age, but many are more prevalent in the 
                            population over 60 years of age. </P>
                          <P align="left"> As psychiatry becomes more biological, 
                            it is assumed that all AXIS I disorders have some 
                            organic basis. When we used the term Organic Mental 
                            Disorder in DSM - III R, we are talking about relative 
                            degrees of organicity. The organicity in these disorders 
                            involves a clear-cut organic element, sometimes called 
                            <I>coarse neurobehavioral</I> syndrome. Clearly these 
                            occur at all ages. However, the elderly is a particularly 
                            important group. DSM -1V dropped the term organic 
                            for such descriptions as &quot;symptomatic&quot; or 
                            &quot;due to medical conditions.&quot; </P>
                          <P align="left"> <I>Neurobehavioral</I> is a term which 
                            is commonly used, particularly in behavioral neurology, 
                            and in neuropsychiatry. This term is particularly 
                            relevant in describing not only the <I>coarse chronic</I> 
                            disorders above, but demarcating a specific lack in 
                            DSM IIIR namely <I>episodic or paroxysmal</I> neurobehavioral 
                            disorders relating to episodic conditions deriving 
                            from a specified condition in the brain such as temporal 
                            lobe disorder linked with "spells" of marked lability 
                            of affect over hours or episodic rage. "Neurobehavioral" 
                            in this context may be perceived as a substitute for 
                            "organic", but will not be part of the official terminology. 
                            Other possible synonyms that still appear in books 
                            and should be recognized are "organic cerebral syndromes", 
                            "organic brain syndromes" and "organic psychosis." 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> The term <I>organic</I> is used in 
                            current psychiatric nomenclature, namely <B>DSM-I11R</B>. 
                            However, the term <I>organic</I> will not be used 
                            in <B>DSM-IV</B>. This is so because most psychiatric 
                            illness is based on organic abnormalities - biochemical, 
                            anatomic or physiologic: For example, schizophrenia 
                            and affective illness are also "organically" based, 
                            so the term <I>organic</I> is ambiguous. Instead, 
                            in <B>DSM-IV</B>, the broad term <I>"cognitive impairment"</I> 
                            will be used. The cognitive impairment disorders include 
                            <I>coarse neurobehavioral</I> disorders like dementia 
                            and delirium. For those conditions in <B>DSM-IV</B> 
                            that have specific etiologies, the term <I>"symptomatic"</I> 
                            will be used, so that we talk of <I>symptomatic delusional 
                            disorder</I> when Vitamin B-12 deficiency may be causing 
                            a delusional condition (as opposed to the current
