                          <P align="left"> The questions below refer to times 
                            when you have <U>not</U> been using alcohol or pleasure

                          <P align="left"> There are two columns marked C and 
                            P. You will be writing a number into both of them 
                            which will allow us to know how often the symptom 
                            or event has happened to you. The left column under 
                            P refers to the <U>greatest frequency in the past</U> 
                            (ie: frequency at which it occurred <U>at its worst</U>); 
                            the column under C refers to your current experience 
                            (how often it has happened recently - today, this 
                            week, month, or year-if rare). </P>
                          <P align="left"> <B>0=never, 1=less than once per year, 
                            2=yearly or more, 3=monthly or more, 4=weekly or more, 
                            5=daily, 6=more than daily.</B> </P>

                            and <B><U>C</u></B>. So if the symptom has never happened, 
                            you will write in 0 under <B><U>C</u></B>and <B><U>P</u></B>. 
                            If another symptom has been happening currently every 
                            day, you would fill in 5 under <B><U>C</u></B>. Let's

                            seemed to speed up for minutes every week (=4). However, 
                            it does not happen currently (=0). He writes the most 
                            frequent number under each column. (i.e. #4 for past, 
                            under <B><U>P</u></B> and zero (0) for current, under

                            happen, he still fills in the 0 because otherwise 
                            his physicians may think he just ignored the question. 
                            He wants to let his physicians know that time was 
                            speeded up, that it lasted for minutes, and that there 
                            was also a sense of timelessness, so he checked each 
                            of those brackets. Also, in the past time was speeded 
                            up weekly (=4) while time was not existing yearly(=2). 
                            He wrote "4" under <B><U>P</u></B> because it was 
                            the most frequent number for this symptom in the past 
                            (i.e. weekly (=4) more frequent than yearly (=2).
