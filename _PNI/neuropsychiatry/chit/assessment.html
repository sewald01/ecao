 <H1>Neuropsychiatry</H1>
                          <P align="left"> The long historical relationship between 
                            neurology and psychiatry impacts the area of transient 
                            traumatic head injury. This neuropsychiatric link 
                            impacts both the actual brain injury facets as well 
                            as the psychological elements. Historically, physicians 
                            interested in the central nervous system focused either 
                            globally on behavior or more specifically on demonstrated 
                            pathology of the central nervous system reflecting 
                            such terms as &quot;post-traumatic&quot; and &quot;post-concussional&quot; 
                            in the brain injury context and interpretations of 
                            etiology that were polarized. Most practitioners in 
                            the area have had very little exposure, if any, to 
                            neuropsychiatry. </P>

                          <P align="left"> Three specialties have approached the 
                            area but from rather diverse origins and conceptual 
                            frameworks. Behavioral neurologists define brain behavior 
                            relationships often through the single case study 
                            with generalizations made about the anatomical basis 
                            of the manifested behavior and specific localization 
                            of similar types of behavior. Neuropsychiatrists emphasize 
                            the phenomenology of behavioral disorders and how 
                            these correlate with diseases in neurology and the 
                            neurologic aspects of behavioral disorders (Tucker 
                            and Neppe, 1988). In head injury, the psyche as well 
                            as the brain are both recognized as interplaying with 
                            each other. Finally, neuropsychologists employ standardized 
                            and objective assessments of intellectual, cognitive 
                            and psychological functioning, emphasizing a more 
                            actuarial and statistical methodology of evaluating 
                            behavior. </P>
                          <P align="left"> While each group appears to look at 
                            different aspects of the same animal, each has identified 
                            important areas of knowledge that are missing in traditional 
                            psychiatric, psychological and neurologic training. 
                            We will focus here primarily on the comparison of

                            the case for a time-based neuropsychiatric approach 
                            applied to the head injury population. </P>
                          <P align="left"> In the context of head injury, exacerbation 
                            of pre-existing conditions commonly occurs. In this 
                            context, neuropsychiatrists recognize that marked 
                            behavior disturbance may correlate with paroxysmal 
                            discharges in the temporal lobe on the electroencephalogram 
                            (Tucker and Neppe, 1994). While these patients would 
                            not be considered to have a seizure disorder by most 
                            behavioral neurologists, many neuropsychiatrists believe 
                            these patients represent a form of seizure disorder 
                            which we for non-prejudicial reasons have called &quot;Paroxysmal 
                            Neurobehavioral Disorder&quot; (Blumer and Neppe, 
                            in press). We have characterized the individual events 
                            as &quot;atypical spells&quot; (Neppe and Tucker, 
                            1992 and 1994; Tucker and Neppe, 1991). Many of these 
                            patients respond to anticonvulsant treatment. Similarly, 
                            a patient on neuroleptic medication who develops an 
                            atypical movement disorder with neuroleptic medication 
                            different biochemically or clinically from extrapyramidal 
                            reactions may still be labelled "tardive dyskinesia" 
                            with a recommendation that the medication be stopped 
                            by the Behavioral Neurologist; the Neuropsychiatrist 
                            may be prepared to recognize such atypicality and 
                            delineate movement disorders different from those 
                            of tardive dyskinesia. </P>

                          <P align="left"> There is a need to incorporate the 
                            neuropsychiatric approach to the often misunderstood 
                            population of patients with closed head injury (Tucker 
                            and Neppe, 1991). A gap exists in the evaluation and 
                            management of patients with closed head injury primarily 
                            because of the differences in approach between neurology 
                            and neuropsychiatry. The neuropsychiatric emphasis 
                            can be a practical and helpful adjunct to the primary 
                            health care providers (neurologists and neuropsychologists) 
                            who are primarily responsible for services provided 
                            to the closed head injury population. The purpose 
                            of this chapter is to discuss the neuropsychiatric 
                            approach and offer some clinical ideas to assist health 
                            care providers in providing a more comprehensive and 
                            thorough evaluation. </P>
							
							 <H1>Controversies of mild traumatic brain injury</H1>
                          <P align="left"> The experimental and scientific understanding 
                            of mild traumatic head injury (MTHI) has evolved over 
                            the past twenty years, with a plethora of research 
                            being generated and documented within the scientific 
                            literature. At the same time, clinical experience 
                            across multidisciplinary lines has increased as health 
                            care professionals have continued to interact with 
                            this population of patients. It has recently been 
                            estimated that approximately two million people annually 
                            in the United States experience closed head injury 
                            (Brown, &amp; Fann, 1994). Closed head injury represents 
                            a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially 
                            within the younger populations. This has resulted 
                            in a considerable increase in health problems associated 
                            with the residual sequelae of closed head injury. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Epidemiological studies have documented 
                            that within the incidence of closed head injury in 
                            general, injuries that are classified as mild or minor 
                            typically account for the greater percentage of cases 
                            evaluated in emergency room and out patient settings 
                            (Goodwin, 1989). This is also the case outside the 
                            United States, where estimates range as high as eighty 
                            percent (Cohadon, Richer, &amp; Castel, 1991). </P>

                          <P align="left"> While the current body of research 
                            literature and experience from clinical practice has 
                            provided a greater understanding of MTHI, there continues 
                            to be controversy with respect to definition and classification 
                            (Kibby, &amp; Long, 1996). Any approach for neuropsychiatric 
                            and/or neuropsychological evaluation of MTHI must 
                            take into account the confusion that exists in understanding 
                            this injury as it is differentiated from more severe 
                            injuries and from other neuropsychiatric disorders. 
                            Earlier attempts at defining the parameters of MTHI 
                            have been seen in the research literature (Colohan, 
                            Dacey, Alves Rimel, Jane, 1986, Davidoff, Kessler, 
                            Laibstain, &amp; Mark, 1988). The Mild Traumatic Brain 
                            Injury Committee of the Head Injury Interdisciplinary 
                            Special Interest Group of the American Congress of 
                            Rehabilitation Medicine has proposed definitive guidelines, 
                            which have been utilized by the research community 
                            in more recent studies (Kay, et al, 1993). More current 
                            proposals for classification of the spectrum of MTHI 
                            have also been suggested (Esselman &amp; Uomoto, 1995). 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Despite the clearer definitive guidelines, 
                            there continues to be clinical confusion in evaluating 
                            and understanding the pathophysiology, symptomatology, 
                            and differential diagnosis of MTHI. The use of the 
                            terms postconcussive syndrome (PCS)and posttraumatic 
                            syndrome (PTS) has been used to describe the pattern 
                            of symptom presentation seen in this population of 
                            patients. However, this has not led to a clearer understanding 
                            of MTHI with respect to evaluation and assessment. 
                            In addition, there have been suggestions that mild 
                            head injuries should be differentiated from mild brain 
                            injuries. Furthermore, there is often the development 
                            of secondary psychiatric disorders that may have a 
                            physiological and/or psychosocioenvironmental basis, 
                            typically referred to among clinicians as psychological 
                            overlay, that complicate the clinical presentation 
                            of MTHI and make the evaluative process more complex. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Clearly, the greatest scientific and 
                            clinical controversy has been associated with the 
                            postconcussive nomenclature (Binder, 1986, Lowden, 
                            Briggs &amp; Cockin, 1989, Alves, Macciocchi, &amp; 
                            Barth, 1993, Kibby &amp; Long, 1996). In general, 
                            PCS has been understood to represent the synergistic 
                            and interactive effects of physical, cognitive and 
                            psychological symptoms seen upon clinical presentation. 
                            The assumption is made that there may be physiologic, 
                            pharmacologic, psychologic, socioenvironmental, circumstantial, 
                            and medicolegal bases underlying the perpetuation 
                            of symptomatology. There is also typically a presentation 
                            of chronic pain syndrome that may have both physical 
                            and psychological factors contributing to the pattern 
                            of symptoms and complaints. Neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological 
                            evaluation of these patients presents the clinician 
                            with a complex task of deciding how to explain the 
                            nature of PCS and more importantly what to recommend 
                            with respect to treatment. </P>

                          <P align="left"> There is also disagreement among researchers 
                            and clinicians as to the duration of PCS and what 
                            factors predispose individuals to developing a persistent 
                            PCS. Within this context, the issue of premorbid factors 
                            such as personality characteristics, past psychiatric 
                            history, previous substance abuse, prior incidence 
                            of MTHI, and general health problems certainly appears 
                            to have an influence on the chronicity of symptoms 
                            (Goodwin, 1989). </P>
                          <P align="left"> Because of the confounding issues inherent 
                            in the diagnostic assessment of the MTHI patient, 
                            a comprehensive time based neuropsychiatric evaluation 
                            is proposed to clinically deal with the complexities 
                            seen in this patient population. Such a time based 
                            evaluation process may not always be necessary, but 
                            in cases where there are confusing diagnostic differentials, 
                            a time based approach will be helpful in guiding the 
                            clinician through the evaluation process. The time 
                            based approach will be presented later on in this 
                            chapter. </P>
                          <P align="left"> We further propose a neuropsychiatric 
                            nomenclature and classification based on the practical 
                            aspects of evaluation, which are more meaningful to 
                            the clinician in everyday practice. These clinical 
                            distinctions should not be considered distinct entities, 
                            but rather as clinical aspects of a dynamic post head 
                            trauma spectrum that can be useful in guiding the 
                            clinician in the evaluation process. We will attempt 
                            to integrate current research findings and clinical 
                            experience into a methodology for neuropsychiatric 
                            evaluation that is first of all useful to the patient 
                            and secondly reflects clinical acumen and multiclinical 
                            diversity. </P>
							
							<H1>A Neuropsychiatric Classification of CHIT: a new 
                            terminology</H1>
                          <P align="left"> We have chosen to modify the definition 
                            proposed by the Interdisciplinary Special Interest 
                            Group of the American Congress of Rehabilitative Medicine 
                            (Kay, et al, 1993). Proposed instead is the use of 
                            the term <I>closed head injury of transient kind</I> 
                            (CHIT) to describe a traumatic induced psychophysiologic 
                            event that occurs to the head which produces initially 
                            little or no unconsciousness, limited retrograde and 
                            anterograde amnesia and alteration of consciousness 
                            that does not last longer than a day. We feel the 
                            term <I>&quot;closed&quot;</I> head injury should 
                            be used because injuries involving skull fractures 
                            and open exposure of the brain have their own special 
                            characteristics such as infection, vascular phenomena 
                            and focal disease. We prefer terms like <I>&quot;head&quot;</I> 
                            to &quot;brain&quot; because this way psychiatric 
                            sequelae are not necessarily implied to have a definite 
                            organic base. We understand that there is an observable 
                            and diagnosable cluster of physical, cognitive and 
                            psychological symptoms that is associated with CHIT 
                            and is most usefully defined as posttraumatic CHIT 
                            syndrome (PTCHITS). Because <I>injury</I> usually 
                            implies &quot;traumatic&quot; we see redundancy in 
                            using terms like traumatic (brain or head) injury: 
                            injury will suffice. Finally, and most important, 
                            we feel it is important to be non-prejudicial at the 
                            outset hence the term <I>transient</I>. CHITs are 
                            often reported to be of <I>mild</I> severity but the 
                            mildness is not invariably so and the trauma may lead 
                            to significant sequelae. Conversely, many so-called 
                            &quot;mild&quot; injuries are more severe because 
                            of the lack of available compensation by the brain. 
                            We believe terms like &quot;mild&quot; (or for that 
                            matter &quot;minor&quot;), &quot; moderate&quot;, 
                            &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;profound&quot; should 
                            be confined to severity of outcome and not assumed 
                            on the basis of initial duration of unconsciousness. 
                            Consequently, we do not like the term &quot;brief&quot; 
                            preferring <I>&quot;transient</I>. Although the two 
                            are similar, brief is more unidimensional in the context 
                            of implying some unconsciousness and not commenting 
                            on duration of clouding or altered consciousness. 
                            &quot;Transient&quot; implies an injury but unconsciousness 
                            may not be proven and it takes this into account. 
                            On the one hand, such an injury can occur without 
                            distinguishable disruption of brain function and yet 
                            still be considered as a traumatic event. Some call 
                            this <I>post-traumatic syndrome</I>. Alternatively, 
                            such an injury can result in a disruption of brain 
                            function and thus be considered transient traumatic 
                            brain injury - some call this <I>post-concussional 
                            syndrome</I>. Additionally, Kurt Goldsteins dichotomy 
                            of &quot;pathogenetic&quot; changes based on the actual 
                            injury and &quot;pathoplastic&quot; compensations 
                            by other areas of the brain or by psychological adaptation 
                            introduces a situation of health as opposed to disease 
                            into the equation (Neppe and Tucker, 1988A). Consequently, 
                            we prefer &quot;transient&quot; in CHIT which we contrast 
                            with &quot;prolonged&quot; and the term <I>CHIP - 
                            closed head injury of prolonged type</I> in which 
                            there is clinically significant retrograde or anterograde 
                            amnesia, extended confusion or clouded consciousness 
                            over more than a day, or prolonged unconsciousness 
                            of more than a day. Transient implies an apparent 
                            blow to the head with no, momentary or very short 
                            consciousness impairments, with the amnesia and confusion 
                            range from momentary to up to a day. In this regard, 
                            CHIPs can always be further subdefined descriptively: 
                            a CHIP with two days coma as opposed to CHIPs with 
                            half hour unconsciousness but two weeks confusion.

                          <P align="left"> Seen within the CHIT syndrome are three 
                            subsyndromes which can occur together: postconcussive 
                            , posttraumatic and focal residual. Assumed by definition 
                            is that with the postconcussive subsyndrome, the brain 
                            has been concussed and there is a predominant physiologic 
                            basis for primary symptoms and secondary psychologic 
                            processes that contribute to the manifestation of 
                            symptom patterns. With the posttraumatic subsyndrome, 
                            there is a predominant feature of acute or chronic 
                            post traumatic stress that represents the primary 
                            cluster of symptoms. With both the postconcussive 
                            and posttraumatic subsyndromes are typically an overlay 
                            of pain syndrome that may have physiologic and/or 
                            psychologic factors that affect the pain behavior. 
                            The focal residual syndrome involves focal dysfunction 
                            such as the development of episodic or paroxysmal 
                            atypical spells or seizure type phenomena. These usually 
                            impact on the cerebral cortex or manifest as a pain 
                            syndrome. </P>

                            to physical, cognitive and psychological symptoms 
                            that typically occur concurrently following an alleged 
                            concussive episode. Within the last five years, the 
                            clinical existence of postconcussive syndrome has 
                            obtained further verification and has become more 
                            widely accepted as a legitimate phenomena (Gouvier, 
                            Cubic, Jones, Brantley, &amp; Cutlip, 1992). Brown, 
                            Fann, &amp; Grant (1994) more recently have purported 
                            that there has been sufficient research generated 
                            to establish that postconcussive symptoms do occur 
                            and they have a predictable configuration. These are 
                            typically acute symptoms of nausea and/or vomiting, 
                            dizziness, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, problems 
                            thinking clearly and quickly and complaints of cervicocranial 
                            pain. </P>

                          <P align="left"> The concussive effect to the brain 
                            can occur with or without direct impact to the head 
                            and there may be no documented loss of consciousness. 
                            There may be a transient change in consciousness with 
                            confusion and disorientation. This mild injury to 
                            the brain may not be observable on routine neurological 
                            examination and typically CT and MRI scanning show 
                            no macroscopic findings. The injury underlying the 
                            PCCHITs is microscopic in nature and can occur diffusely 
                            throughout the brain. There is a high preponderance 
                            of involvement in the frontopolar, orbitofrontal and 
                            anterior temporal regions of the brain. These areas 
                            are more susceptible to the effects of acceleration/deceleration, 
                            rotational and coup/contrecoup injury, which is often 
                            the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of the concussive 
                            episode. The PCCHITs develops primarily as a result 
                            of the disruption of normal brain functioning. </P>

							<H2>Posttraumatic Subsyndrome in CHIT (PTCHITS)</H2>
                          <P align="left"> The post-traumatic subsyndrome represents 
                            a spectrum of posttraumatic symptoms commonly referred 
                            to within the context of DSM IV as acute stress disorder 
                            and post- traumatic stress disorder. This constellation 
                            of symptoms is considered functional in nature and 
                            represents a psychological reactivity to the traumatic 
                            event. It is assumed that when an individual experiences 
                            trauma to the head during an event such as assault, 
                            moving vehicle accident, slip &amp; fall, or other 
                            traumatic circumstances, there is the potential, inherent 
                            in these situations, for the development of predictable 
                            characteristic symptoms considered to be posttraumatic 
                            in nature. </P>
                          <P align="left"> The primary basis for the development 
                            of posttraumatic symptoms is a functional response 
                            by the individual to the traumatic event. There may 
                            be other physical findings associated with the event 
                            that may occur as a consequence of the trauma, but 
                            these are considered secondary with respect to etiology. 
                            It is obviously of clinical importance for the clinician 
                            to differentiate post-traumatic subsyndrome from postconcussive 
                            subsyndrome. While many patients with postconcussive 
                            symptoms also may develop posttraumatic symptoms, 
                            clearly there are those patients, who experience trauma 
                            to the head, which is not concussive in nature, and 
                            present with minimal changes in intellectual and cognitive 
                            functioning, but seem to develop posttraumatic symptomatology.

                            differentiating this potential diagnostic overlap 
                            is to have the patient complete neuropsychological 
                            testing, in order to provide a more comprehensive 
                            diagnostic assessment of cognitive functioning. Patients

							  <H2>Focal residual brain syndromes in CHIT (FRCHITs)</H2>

                            often seen within this psychologic subgroup of PCCHITs

                            of personality changes often becomes more observable 
                            as the acute effects of the PC injury resolve. These 
                            patients may lack the ability to be fully aware of 
                            how they have changed. They may seem indifferent and 
                            apathetic and may even describe themselves as being 
                            less bothered by the stresses and strains of life. 
                            These patients lack insight and become more passive. 
                            Amotivation is often a major problem. Alternatively, 
                            the frontal lobe manifestation may be an increase 
                            in aggressivity and explosive behavior. These patients 
                            exhibit diminished judgmental ability and are often 
                            described as impulsive. In both frontal lobe groups 
                            there may be measurable deficits in intellectual and 
                            cognitive functioning, for which the patient may only 
                            be minimally aware. Occasionally these patients exhibit 
                            frontal lobe release reflexes (e.g. pout, snout) on

                            clinical practice. These patients may have focal residual 
                            features as well. We call them MCHITs or Mixed CHIT 
                            Syndrom$ </P>
                          <P align="left"> This neuropsychiatric classification 
                            system provides a practical, clinical based approach 
                            for beginning the evaluation process. An understanding 
                            of the differentiating features of CHITs can give 
                            the health care provider more specific direction when 
                            beginning evaluation. The predominant features of 
                            MCHITs presented during diagnostic interviewing can 
                            be classified and differentiated into more specific 
                            sub categories, which can be used to determine the 
                            specificity of the neuropsychiatric evaluation. </P>

                          <P align="left"> Most patients with primary psychiatric 
                            illness have some seeds of previous psychiatric symptoms 
                            in their histories. When the patient presents with 
                            a good premorbid social history, a good work history, 
                            and a warm and supportive family and changes in behavior 
                            particularly abrupt changes in personality, mood, 
                            or ability to function, occur after CHIT, the CHIT 
                            must be considered a prime etiologic candidate. Similarly, 
                            the patient who presents with rapid fluctuations in 
                            mental status or rapid variable motor behavior frequently 
                            suggests something other than the typical psychiatric 
                            disorders - it is unusual for schizophrenics to be 
                            hallucinating and delusional in the morning and clear 
                            in the afternoon (Neppe , Tucker, 1989). </P>
							
							<H2>The Time Based Neuropsychiatric Evaluation</H2>
                          <P align="left"> Simply stated, the time based evaluation 
                            presupposes that traditional evaluation procedures 
                            may not always be sufficient in properly understanding 
                            the etiology and manifestations of the CHITS. The 
                            traditional neuropsychiatri$ evaluation has routinely 
                            consisted of a diagnostic interview process, review 
                            of background information, mental status examination 
                            and possibly some lab testing. This is often accomplished 
                            in a single session or over two sessions with the 
                            patient. If predominant cognitive sequelae exist, 
                            a referral to a neuropsychologist is often made. </P>
                          <P align="left"> The neuropsychologist or neuropsychiatrist 
                            in turn completes another one time clinical interview, 
                            administers a battery of neuropsychological tests, 
                            reviews available medical and other pertinent records, 
                            and forms a clinical impression based on this limited 
                            time with the patient. At times, there may be additional 
                            collateral information obtained from significant others, 
                            usually obtained during a single session. </P>

                          <P align="left"> This traditional process of evaluation 
                            gives the clinician a sample of the patients physical, 
                            cognitive and psychological behavior that is essentially 
                            a snapshot view much like the instant results obtained 
                            from the Polaroid picture. The information obtained 
                            from this snapshot approach gives the clinician a 
                            small slice of how the patient is functioning at a 
                            given point in time. This represents a very limited 
                            sample of the patients behavior. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Yet as health care providers, we continue 
                            to evaluate patients with CHITs in this way and we 
                            make inferential leaps and generalizations affecting 
                            our conclusions and our recommendations. While this 
                            approach may be sufficient in assessing many clinical 
                            syndromes, it can lead to many false positives and 
                            false negatives within the population of head trauma 
                            patients. The current data base of research findings 
                            and multidisciplinary clinical experience would suggest 
                            that this snapshot approach does not give the evaluator 
                            enough information to clearly understand the dynamics 
                            presented in many patients with CHIT. </P>
                          <P align="left"> There are obviously many cases of CHIT 
                            where the findings derived from a single snapshot 
                            approach to evaluation will be sufficient to make 
                            appropriate recommendations. However, clinical experience 
                            has shown that there is often a need to defer final 
                            clinical impression until the clinician has had more 
                            time with the patient. This is encountered frequently 
                            among clinicians who work with the head injured patient 
                            on a daily basis. </P>
                          <P align="left"> When clinicians begin the evaluation 
                            process with a patient, we often make underlying assumptions 
                            with respect to the patients abilities as a historian. 
                            We usually collect our data directly from the patients 
                            report. We fail to realize that with patients experiencing 
                            head trauma symptoms, there is usually a diminished 
                            ability to be aware of ones self and insight is often 
                            reduced. Furthermore, there are concurrent deficits 
                            in expressive speech that limit the patient in their 
                            attempt to completely express the full range of their 
                            ideas and recollections about their functioning. These 
                            patients almost always complain of difficulty expressing 
                            their thoughts and ideas and formulating a self-analysis 
                            of their behavior. When the very part of us as human 
                            beings that we refer to as &quot;self&quot; is experienced 
                            as changed because of underlying pathophysiological 
                            disruption, it is difficult to fully appreciate the 
                            meaning and effects of this change, let alone try 
                            to express this clearly and cogently during the brief 
                            time period of diagnostic interviewing. We must always 
                            remember that when we refer to head trauma we are 
                            also referring to trauma to the mind and its ability 
                            to experience and cope with the after effects of the 
                            trauma and in turn communicate these after effects 
                            to health care providers. </P>

                          <P align="left"> When these patients present their complex 
                            constellation of physical, cognitive and psychological 
                            changes following head trauma, the clinician needs 
                            to give them the time to render a comprehensive self 
                            report. Because of diminished awareness and insight, 
                            a patient may not be able to fully convey the qualitative

                            provider. Memory problems are typically one of the 
                            chief complaints in the CHIT syndrome. This makes 
                            it difficult for patients to organize and recall their 
                            experience of changes in their perception of self.

                            everyday life. This topographic elicitation of symptom

                            of not diagnosed because evaluations are too short. 
                            In some instances, particular conditions are especially 
                            undiagnosed: in our experience, many have CPSzs which 
                            remain undetected and moreover false reassurance by 
                            practitioners doing such single or cursory evaluations 
                            ultimately may harm the patient: the condition is 
                            not diagnosed and the patient regards his/ her symptoms 
                            as psychological when there is a good physical base. 
                            Moreover, sometimes when symptoms have persisted over 
                            months, the patient is investigated neuroradiologically 
                            and when no positive findings are found, this is in

                            month, no longer can be found and this implies not 
                            psychological etiology but incorrect timing of the

                            and investigation information. This allows for a detailed 
                            multi-axial neuropsychiatric diagnosis and a road-map

                            and non-pharmacologic. To facilitate the report being 
                            properly read, whereas all areas may be important,

                                The INSET involves screening for possible temporal 
                                lobe, epileptic and organic symptoms and spells. 
                                Thereafter the symptoms are categorized into several

                            <P align="left"> We have also developed several less 
                              commonly used paper and pencil neuropsychiatric 
                              instruments which are applied when appropriate. 
                              One is the <B>Neppe narcolepsy screen</B> which 
                              has not been well researched. Narcolepsy is a rare 
                              condition itself (incidence possibly 1 in several 
                              thousand individuals). However, the questionnaire 
                              is far more versatile probing sleep disturbance 
                              as well as anomalistic experiences and these are 
                              common in the CHIT patient. Unfortunately, the questionnaire 
                              needs to be scored by paper and pencil at this stage 
                              and there are no norms so that although highly relevant 
                              history information is obtained at a clinical level, 
                              a clinician needs to interpret the results. </P>
                            <P align="left"> The <B>Neppe D&eacute;j&agrave; vu 
                              Questionnaires</B> are other screening history instruments 
                              seldom used in clinical practice. However, the major 
                              value of this well validated instrument is to demonstrate 
                              how we cannot interpret symptoms not elicited in 
                              detail as the same. Using a phenomenological analysis, 
                              Neppe was able to demonstrate that the symptom of 
                              d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, commonly regarded as symptomatic 
                              of temporal lobe epilepsy indeed had a very special 
                              phenomenologic quality in patients with temporal 
                              lobe epilepsy (Neppe, 1983A). This involves its 
                              association with post-ictal features such as sleepiness, 
                              headache and clouded consciousness and its link 
                              in time with these features. This association provides 
                              an excellent clue to the existence of temporal lobe 
                              epilepsy but d&eacute;j&agrave; vu is a normal phenomenon 
                              occurring in 70 percent of the population and unless 
                              such phenomenological detail is obtained, patients' 
                              symptomatology may be misinterpreted (Neppe, 1983 
                              A). Neppe has similarly done such a study with olfactory 
                              hallucinations (Neppe, 1983 B, 1984). A specific 
                              type of temporal lobe epilepsy olfactory hallucination 
                              could not be demonstrated although there were suggestive 
                              features. </P>

                              to more formal standardized evaluations. Routinely 
                              at our institute, we evaluate patients using two 
                              computerized psychological instruments - The MMPI 
                              or its adolescent version - and the Symptom Check 
                              List 90. There is strong support to use personality 
                              evaluations and some would debate the Millon Clinical 
                              Multiaxial Inventory (MMCI) should be used instead 
                              of or in addition to the MMPI. We believe it useful 
                              to screen current psychological symptoms hence the 
                              use of the SCL 90. We do not find this an ideal

                              believe they are valuable. We have also considered 
                              adding the SCID to our instrumentation. We precede

                            <P align="left"> Within the head trauma population, 
                              perhaps the area that is the most difficult to understand 
                              for both patient and provider, and often the most 
                              complex, is the assessment of personality. Early 
                              research in this area (Thomsen, 1974) revealed that 
                              families of head trauma patients reported changes 
                              in personality to be more of a burden to them than 
                              residual physical problems. Goethe and Levin (1984) 
                              conclude that family complaints about head injured 
                              patients center around personality and behavior 
                              changes rather than physical disabilities, and family 
                              tensions typically increase as time goes even up 
                              to two years following an injury. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Assessing potential changes in personality 
                              obviously cannot be accomplished properly within 
                              an hour or hour and a half diagnostic interview 
                              with the patient. Understanding the subtle yet complex 
                              changes that can occur in personality dynamics following 
                              head trauma is primarily the basis for advocating 
                              a time based evaluation process. Far too often misdiagnosis 
                              is made with respect to the presence or absence 
                              of personality disorders. As clinicians, we simply 
                              need to humble ourselves and not be so quick to 
                              make clinical judgments based on limited time with 
                              the patient. </P>

                            <P align="left"> From the time period of the 1970s 
                              through the 1980s the epidemiological, neurological 
                              and neuropsychological evaluation of minor traumatic 
                              head injury has produced a greater awareness of 
                              the changes that can occur in intellectual and cognitive 
                              functioning (OHara, 1988). Within the last five 
                              to ten years there has continued to be research 
                              generated on the definitions and neuropsychological 
                              aspects of minor head trauma (Kibby &amp; Long, 
                              1996, Esselman &amp; Uomoto, 1995, Cohadon, Richer, 
                              &amp; Castel, 1991, Alves, Macciocchi &amp; Barth, 
                              1993, Lowdon, Briggs, &amp; Cockin, 1989). There 
                              has however, been much less research and clinical 
                              literature written on the neuropsychiatric aspects 
                              of head trauma. McAllister (1992) discusses neuropsychiatric 
                              sequelae of head trauma in terms of pathophysiology, 
                              cognitive sequelae, behavior, effects of age, and 
                              treatment. Also within the past five years, studies 
                              emphasizing personality issues following head trauma 
                              have increased our awareness of the need to understand 
                              this aspect of the head trauma spectrum (Middleboe, 
                              Birket-Smith, Anderson, &amp; Friis, 1992, Miller, 
                              1992). There is a great need within the health profession 
                              to appreciate the subtle, yet significant changes 
                              in personality that can occur with head trauma, 
                              and to get beyond the purely clinical aspects of 
                              assessing these changes to recognize the trauma 
                              to the self. Clinicians who work day in and day 
                              out with head trauma patients will attest to the 
                              difficulties these patients experience when their 
                              equilibrium of self has been altered by trauma and 
                              brain injury. </P>
                            <P align="left"> In addressing this issue, it must 
                              be reiterated again that to fully evaluate these 
                              changes in personality takes time. Initially, the 
                              patient is often preoccupied with problems with 
                              pain and they are not yet aware of changes in themselves. 
                              As recovery progresses, there is more awareness 
                              of the cognitive and psychological problems. When 
                              patients begin to feel better physically, they attempt 
                              to get back in the swing of things and this is usually 
                              the time period when they begin to notice that they 
                              do not feel the same. As cognitive sequelae resolve, 
                              they return to work and reintegrate into social 
                              and leisure activities. However, continued reduction 
                              in tolerance, irritability, emotional volatility, 
                              and mental and emotional fatigue are experienced 
                              on a daily basis. </P>

                            <P align="left"> These subtle residuals are typically 
                              difficult to assess in the clinical setting. Yet, 
                              time spent with these patients will often reveal 
                              the struggle they experience in trying to cope with 
                              everyday life. They are constantly reminded by the 
                              difficulties they encounter that they have changed 
                              and that they feel different. There is often a longing 
                              to be like they used to be and get their life back 
                              to what it used to be. But the truth of the matter 
                              is that many of these patients will never regain 
                              the old self and be able to capture the sense of

                              as simply a manifestation of a personality disorder, 
                              when in fact it is a manifestation of impaired coping 
                              and the expression of futility at being unable to 
                              deal with life effectively. There is the constant 
                              experience of reduced cognitive stamina even though 
                              many frank cognitive symptoms have resolved. This 
                              usually takes the form of inability to keep up with 
                              the demands of life and inability to enjoy the process 
                              of living. There is often an anhedonic experience 
                              of going through the motions of living but without 
                              the ability to fully enjoy life events. These patients 
                              will often feel like they are on the outside looking 
                              in and not really participating. They feel detached 
                              and surrealistic about living. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Patients with a primary concussive 
                              injury and patients with predominant posttraumatic 
                              reaction can experience these changes in their sense 
                              of self. As a starting point for adequately assessing 
                              these issues it is usually helpful to have a psychological 
                              consultation incorporating some standardized, objective 
                              measures such as the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III (Millon 
                              Clinical Multiaxial Inventory). This is useful in 
                              differentiating predominantly posttraumatic symptomatology 
                              from postconcussive complaints. The MMPI-2 is helpful 
                              in assessing primary features of psychological functioning 
                              and can be supplemented with the MCMI-III to gain 
                              a more in depth analysis of personality traits and 
                              style. This can guide the clinician in how to approach 
                              treatment. Patients with more extreme elevations 
                              on the MMPI-2 are typically experiencing greater 
                              distress and there may be a need for psychopharmacologic 
                              intervention. Examining personality style from the 
                              MCMI-III can give the clinician valuable information 
                              on how the expression of symptomatology will be 
                              seen by others and the relative strengths and weaknesses 
                              in personality structure. </P>

                              It is designed as a screening instrument for psychopathology 
                              in psychiatric, medical, and nonpatient populations. 
                              The scoring profile is expressed in percentile rankings

                              issues are usually inherent in medicolegal cases. 
                              Both the MMPI-2 and MCMI-III can be helpful in detecting

                            <P align="left"> Under-reporting of symptoms can often 
                              be related to the denial that is seen in patients 
                              with head trauma. These patients are acutely aware 
                              of problems in cognitive and psychological functioning, 
                              but often minimize these problems, hoping they will 
                              just go away. During a cursory initial clinical 
                              interview, the clinician can be misled into concluding 
                              that the patient is not in any significant distress, 
                              when in actuality they are often presenting themselves 
                              in a favorable light because it is too difficult 
                              for them to admit to the type of symptoms they are 
                              experiencing. Patients are often embarrassed to 
                              admit to having problems in their cognitive functioning. 
                              There is also a tendency to minimize problems with 
                              irritability, emotional volatility and reduced tolerance, 
                              as these problems may not be consistent with how 
                              they would like things to be. When there is consistency 
                              between psychological testing and clinical impression, 
                              this issue can be the catalyst to initiate a realistic 
                              acceptance of these problem areas so that recovery 
                              can be further facilitated. </P>
                            <P align="left"> On the other hand, over-reporting 
                              of symptomatology is a much debated issue whenever 
                              there are potential sources of secondary gain such 
                              as the case is in litigation. After ruling out other 
                              possible explanations of extreme elevations in clinical 
                              profiles from the MMPI-2 and less often the MCMI-III, 
                              the clinician can often detect this mind set towards 
                              exaggeration and be in a better position to explain 
                              the basis of persisting symptoms. This issue is 
                              almost always a part of the postconcussive spectrum 
                              and should be thoroughly evaluated. More often than 
                              not, patients may be magnifying symptoms rather 
                              than outright malingering. In addition, many patients 
                              magnify symptoms because of their need to convince 
                              the clinician that they really are having a legitimate 
                              problem. Intentional magnification of symptomatology 
                              is far less common than typically thought of among 
                              health care professionals and the legal community. 
                              Again, it should be pointed out that clarifying 
                              these issues takes time and the most valid and reliable 
                              assessment of under-reporting or over-reporting, 
                              regardless of the results of psychological testing, 
                              is to see the patient over a number of sessions 
                              to document the consistency of their symptom presentation.

                                including the CHIT that may be the current main 
                                complaint. For most patients this should be performed

                                physicians assistants often obtain this history.

                              (Folstein, 1975), is quickly administered and requires 
                              little training, but has little predictive power 
                              for diagnosis or classification of coarse neurobehavioral 
                              syndromes, and is not designed to detect mild cortical

                              focal pathology is not effectively screened. Only 
                              30% of multi-infarct dementia patients (Babikian, 
                              1990) and 68% of Alzheimer's dementia patients scored 
                              below the recommended cut-off of 24/30 on the MMSE, 
                              raising questions about the test's sensitivity (Galasko, 
                              1990). Even more seriously, 85% were false-positive 
                              for the diagnosis of dementia, raising questions 
                              about its use in a geriatric community setting (Gagnon, 
                              1990). The MMSE also correlates poorly with basic 
                              everyday living skills (Katz ADL Scale)(Ferrell, 
                              1990), education and intelligence level, right hemisphere

                              and organization, "C" for concentration and calculation, 
                              "A" for apraxia and agnosia, and "S" for speech 
                              and sensory-motor-reflex. Each ROCAS category is 
                              scored from zero (no impairment) to 10 (gross impairment). 
                              The 40 items which compose the 10 ROCAS categories 
                              are tabulated on a two-dimensional score sheet (Figures 
                              1a and 1b). The result is expressed as the BROCAS 
                              profile (Behavior + ROCAS), which reflects clinical 
                              and neuropsychiatric features. </P>

                              evaluation for abnormal involuntary movements. </P>
                            <P align="left"> STRAW is an acronym for a new technique 
                              of evaluating involuntary movements, particularly 
                              tardive dyskinesia. Neppe developed the STRAW in 
                              the early 1990s because of the non-availability 
                              of adequate measures which would reliably differentiate 
                              subtle differences in tardive dyskinesia, and which 
                              could be easily scored within a 10% range by several 
                              different raters. </P>

                            <P align="left"> The STRAW has two components, a timing 
                              component and a severity component. The STRAW timing 
                              system involves equal scores of 50 for activation 
                              and rest. The key to the STRAW is the timed component. 
                              The timing component is scored out of 100 based 
                              on a time period using the criterion of presence. 
                              Tremor and epileptic seizure are not included as 
                              involuntary movements. </P>

                              and standing - the score is a rest score. The five 
                              evaluations during activity are each out of 10 making 
                              up 50 for activity (the TRAW) loaded equally with 
                              the 50 for rest (the S of the STRAW). </P>
                            <P align="left"> Three body sections are measured 
                              for severity: the head, the axial skeleton, and 
                              the limbs. Each body section is rated between 0 
                              and 10 in severity . In practice, the most severe 
                              of these three rankings is the one that is most 
                              closely followed over a period of time for tardive

                            <P align="left"> The STRAW timing system is multiplied

                              of 1000. It is thereafter divided by 10 to score 
                              out of 100. This gives an index of both severity 
                              and duration of particular physical signs. Table

                              development of the EEG (by the neuropsychiatrist, 
                              Dr. Hans Berger in the 1930's) all seizure disorders 
                              were classified with mental disorders (Neppe, Tucker, 
                              1988A, 1988B, 1992). EEG technology remains rather 
                              primitive and reflections of brain waves from the 
                              perspective of analysis of psychopathology somewhat 
                              limited. Nevertheless, the only definitive way of 
                              demonstrating that a symptom or physical sign such 
                              as, for example, an olfactory hallucination is definitely 
                              epileptic, is the demonstration of correlates of 
                              seizure phenomena on EEG, such as spike-wave paroxysms, 
                              while the person is having that experience. This 
                              is unusual unless the seizure phenomena are relatively 
                              uncontrolled. Even in the event of them having such 
                              an experience, the EEG correlate may not necessarily 
                              be of a spike kind but depending on location, it 
                              could be normal or show a marked slowing, with a 
                              nonspecific theta rhythm generally of limited help 
                              unless focal or a delta rhythm, which is frankly 
                              abnormal unless the patient is asleep (theta is 
                              4 to 7 cycles per second, delta is less than 4). 
                              It is occasionally extremely difficult to localize 
                              such features on scalp EEG even when firing is occurring 
                              because symptoms may occur from the mesial temporal 
                              or deep structures within the brain which do not 
                              easily manifest on surface EEGs (Tucker, Neppe, 
                              1984, 1988). </P>
                            <H3 align="left">Special electrode placements</H3>
                            <P align="left"> Special techniques have been used 
                              to overcome the problem. One commonly used technique 
                              was nasopharyngeal electrodes but the increased 
                              yield with nasopharyngeal electrodes is insubstantial. 
                              A second placement is sphenoidal electrodes which 
                              unfortunately, requires time, expertise and discomfort 
                              limiting availability. A recent new suggestion has 
                              been the placement of electrodes on the buccal skin 
                              surface in the area of the submandibular notch - 
                              possibly as effective in picking up foci as sphenoidal 
                              placements. Finally, cerebral cortical placements 
                              during neurosurgery procedures may show firing, 
                              for example, in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy 
                              and psychosis, in the region of the hippocampus. 
                              The direct placement of intracranial electrodes 
                              shows how commonly spike firing may be occurring 
                              in this area with no correlate of any kind on surface 
                              EEGs (Neppe, Tucker, 1988A, 1988B, 1992).</P>
                            <H3 align="left">Sleep EEG records</H3>
                            <P align="left"> There are several methods that are 
                              used for evoking electroencephalographic abnormalities. 
                              Sleep records increase the potential delineation 
                              of focal abnormality such as a temporal lobe focus 
                              by approximately fourfold. The administration of 
                              chloral hydrate, 1 to 3 grams as premedication prior 
                              to the sleep record is useful as this induces little 
                              change of significance in the electroencephalogram 
                              and does not prevent the demonstration of focal 
                              abnormalities. Certain medications should be particularly 
                              avoided in this regard. The first is the benzodiazepine 
                              group which may have by virtue of their very strong 
                              anti-epileptic effects profound effects in normalizing 
                              the EEG. Such effects at a receptor level may last 
                              weeks even with the apparent short acting benzodiazepines 
                              so that the yield of demonstrating epilepsy after 
                              the patient has had benzodiazepines administered 
                              apparently decreases substantially, although adequate 
                              data in this regard is not easily available (Neppe, 
                              1984). Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are 
                              also important evokers of abnormality in EEGs. </P>

                              involves prolonged monitoring over periods of time 
                              varying from 12 hours to 2 weeks while the patient 
                              is generally confined to a particular room. Cable 
                              telemetry, is most commonly used. This involves, 
                              for example, a 25 foot cable connected to the EEG 
                              montage on the patient's head. Very often no seizure 
                              manifestations are picked up for prolonged periods 
                              of time because seizures only occur paroxysmally. 
                              Moreover, those patients evaluated in a specialized 
                              center with EEG telemetry are invariably so atypical 
                              that the hypothesized seizure originates deep within 
                              the brain. The apparatus costs over $100,000 and 
                              the costs involved in monitoring patients are thousands 
                              per day at times for two weeks. Instead, home ambulatory 
                              electroencephalograms are easily available (Neppe, 
                              Tucker, 1988A, 1988B, 1992), (Neppe, Tucker, 1988A, 
                              1988B, 1992). </P>

                              is a valuable test when the patient's symptomatology 
                              needs to be monitored day and night in a natural 
                              environment of home using computerized filtering 
                              of artefact. The advantage of this technique is 
                              to establish if any scalp electrode can detect events 
                              such as atypical spells alerted to by pushbuttons 
                              reflecting deep brain electrical activity. It has 
                              limited availability at this point, however, but 
                              our pick up rate for atypical spells and seizures 
                              is high. </P>

                              may ultimately change the whole perspective in its

                                lesion investigations are sometimes necessary 
                                during the acute phase to ensure that secondary 
                                bleeding has not occurred. Usually, this is clear 
                                based on neurologic deficits or deterioration 
                                of some kind. However, if neuroradiologic anatomic

                            <P align="left"> We have stated previously that the 
                              patient with head injury symptoms is likely to have 
                              difficulty expressing their thoughts and ideas. 
                              This may be due to expressive deficits, a reduction 
                              In self awareness, or secondary to memory problems. 
                              Many patients with postconcussive symptoms experience 
                              a reduction in spontaneous word production and are 
                              unable to communicate the full extent of the changes 
                              in cognitive and psychological functioning. Patients 
                              with expressive problems often come up short in 
                              trying to explain the daily problems they are encountering. 
                              There may be dysnomia, poverty of thought content, 
                              and loss of their train of thought. This can result 
                              in inadequate clinical information being given to 
                              the health care provider, who in turn may under 
                              diagnose due to the appearance of minimal symptom 
                              presentation. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Concurrently, there may be an inability 
                              to fully appreciate the extent of cognitive problems 
                              or psychological changes. This can be due to denial 
                              and/or loss of ability to be aware of self and to 
                              engage in insightful introspection or self analysis. 
                              This is often seen with the frontal dysexecutive 
                              syndrome. These patients do not fully appreciate 
                              the changes in cognitive and psychological functioning 
                              that significant others are keenly aware of. </P>
                            <P align="left"> On the other hand, many patients 
                              go through a phase of denial, where they minimize 
                              their postconcussive problems and may present themselves 
                              in the most favorable light. This is often the case 
                              where patients have been inappropriately reassured 
                              by medical personnel that they will be back to normal 
                              within a relatively short period of time, or that 
                              there is nothing to worry about, or that their symptoms 
                              will gradually diminish with time and there is very 
                              little that can be done to treat them. When they 
                              continue to experience difficulty in cognitive functioning, 
                              continue to have problems with pain, and are unable 
                              to cope effectively, they experience cognitive dissonance 
                              because of their belief that they should be improving. 
                              They may deny or try to hide or minimize their difficulties 
                              with the hope that it will just go away. There may 
                              be embarrassment with regards to their cognitive 
                              problems, irritability and emotional volatility. 
                              These problems may often be obscured by the patient 
                              telling others that they just dont feel well. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Most patients with head trauma symptomatology 
                              experience memory problems. Impairments in memory 
                              processing may be due to concussive injury or as 
                              part of the spectrum of posttraumatic disorder or 
                              depression. These patients simply forget how they 
                              are doing from day to day. They may be experiencing 
                              a multiplicity of problems, but are unable to retrieve 
                              this information during the time spent with the 
                              health care provider. This may lead to the impression 
                              that a given patient is not experiencing any significant 
                              problems because they have not been able to adequately 
                              remember the instances of cognitive dysfunctioning 
                              or emotional overreactivity on a day to day basis.

                            <P align="left"> It is for these reasons that it is 
                              crucial to interview significant others or acquaintances 
                              who have known the patient for some time before 
                              the injury and have been in regular contact with 
                              the patient following the injury. Where possible, 
                              these friends and family members should have had 
                              routine contact with the patient before the injury 
                              and be able to describe their premorbid behavior. 
                              These individuals will be able to document any changes 
                              that have taken place by way of their regular interactions 
                              with the patient. This collateral information is 
                              often more accurate than information given by the 
                              patient. The clinician should be careful to ask 
                              about physical, cognitive and psychological functioning. 
                              The most important issue to establish is whether 
                              or not the significant other or acquaintance has 
                              observed changes in the patients behavior following

                              of complaints. It is important to ask about changes 
                              in the patients sense of smell and taste, since 
                              there is often a loss or partial loss of olfactory 
                              processes. This is often an overlooked symptom in 
                              the mild to moderate head injury population. Information 
                              should be gathered as to any complaints the patient 
                              may be making regarding more subtle changes in functioning 
                              such as sensitivity to bright light (sunlight or 
                              night driving), the sensation of obscurity to their 
                              visual acuity, ringing in the ears, intolerance 
                              to noise or distractions during active concentration, 
                              problems with coordination and tactile dexterity,

                            <P align="left"> During a review of the patients cognitive 
                              functioning, the clinician should ask about situational 
                              manifestations of cognitive problems. The clinician 
                              needs to know how the patient is functioning across 
                              different situations and within a variety of environments. 
                              It is important to know if the patients cognitive 
                              changes are obvious to others and whether or not 
                              the patient is relying on others to compensate for 
                              his cognitive difficulties. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Primary care group members should 
                              be asked about the patients flow of thinking including 
                              speed of information processing, attention and concentration. 
                              The clinician should try to ascertain whether the 
                              patient is able to maintain and sustain attention 
                              and concentration and if there is distractibility. 
                              Memory processing should be thoroughly evaluated 
                              to establish a pattern of memory problems that is 
                              specific to that patient. It is not enough to just 
                              document the presence or absence of memory problems. 
                              It is also important to review the patients problem 
                              solving abilities, organizational skills, reasoning, 
                              the ability to perform sequential activities and 
                              make schedules and plan ahead. Mental arithmetic 
                              reasoning should be asked about regarding the patients 
                              ability to keep up with finances, make change, and 
                              estimate necessary everyday calculations. The clinician 
                              should ask about the patients ability to express 
                              themselves, word finding difficulties, losing their 
                              train of thought and the style of speech. The patients 
                              comprehension and receptive language abilities should 
                              also be reviewed including reading comprehension, 
                              the ability to follow TV programs, and how well 
                              the patient understands and responds to others.

                              for obtaining collateral information is to document 
                              and describe the changes in psychological functioning. 
                              Head trauma patients typically are better historians 
                              with respect to their physical functioning, but 
                              have more difficulty describing changes in themselves. 
                              Individuals who know the patient well are often

                              determine whether the patient is more irritable, 
                              is less patient with others, has low frustration

                              about frontal lobe behavior, especially increased 
                              passivity or aggressivity. Routine questions should 
                              also be included to asses other areas of psychological 
                              functioning in consideration of secondary psychological

                          <P align="left"> Evaluations of the closed head injuries 
                            of transient kind are therefore areas for fertile 
                            research as what was previously regarded as irrelevant 
                            are now realized to be significant. Many patients 
                            with CHITs have not been regarded as ill when, in 
                            actuality, they were so impaired that their day to 
                            day functioning was that interfered with. Only by 
                            detailed, time-based, cross-sectional evaluations 
                            can one develop enough longitudinal perspective to 
                            be able to manage the patient appropriately and to 
                            appreciate better their strengths and their limitations. 
                            Certain pointers on management are dealt with in a 
                            later chapter (Neppe, Goodwin, 1998 in press). </P>
