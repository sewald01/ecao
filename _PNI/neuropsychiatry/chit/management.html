                          <H2>BACKGROUND TO ASSESSMENT OF THE CHIT</H2>
                          <P align="left">We have defined the &quot;closed head 
                            injury syndrome of transient kind&quot; (CHIT) as 
                            having several subtypes: a physiological brain injury 
                            of the post concussional dimension (PCCHITs), a psychological 
                            dysfunction of post-traumatic kind (PTCHITs), a focal 
                            residual kind (FRCHITs) or combinations mixed with 
                            these (MCHITs). Further, there is a synergistic physical, 
                            cognitive and psychological synergism across the post 
                            traumatic functional syndrome and legitimate brain 
                            injury and predisposing factors and degrees of physiological 
                            brain reserve may determine exact manifestations of 
                            a CHIT. (Neppe and Goodwin, In Press)</P>
                          <P align="left">We have seen how &quot;minor&quot; CHI 
                            is often not minor. The misnomer of mild often is 
                            linked with significant and brief, or no impairments 
                            of consciousness may be associated with significant 
                            residua of the CHIT. Some patients may manifest pathoplastic 
                            compensations less with pre-existing conditions such 
                            that the symptoms of the CHIT may relate to the straw 
                            that broke the camel's back. Additionally, the actual 
                            pathogenetic changes in CHITs may manifest in both 
                            focal and generalized forms. (Neppe and Goodwin, In 
                            Press)</P>
                          <P align="left">We have demonstrated how time based 
                            evaluations of comprehensive kind may be the most 
                            valuable way of monitoring of the headache, dizziness, 
                            concentration, myalgic pains, memory disturbance and 
                            sleep disturbance and specific complications including 
                            seizure disorders, atypical spells and fibromyalgia 
                            that may follow CHITs. The neuropsychiatric evaluation 
                            is not a single interview over forty minutes or an 
                            hour. It cannot be done in one interview: it is too 
                            complex and, moreover, the time based evaluation allows 
                            a film strip view in which the whole system, all the 
                            biopsychofamiliosociocultural elements, must be taken 
                            into account. (Neppe and Goodwin, In Press)</P>
                          <P align="left">The sequence of such a basic exam involves 
                            outside sources of history and information, demographics

                            psychiatric, mental status, and neuropsychiatric cerebral 
                            cortical evaluations. Furthermore, specialized testing 
                            is then done. All this information is then elaborated 
                            and examined producing diagnoses using a multiaxial 
                            framework of both neurologic and psychiatric kind. 
                            Consequently, management of the patient with a CHIT 
                            requires comprehensive time based evaluations and 
                            significant planning. Such handling is both pharmacological 
                            and non-pharmacological. (Neppe and Goodwin, In Press)</P>

                            CHIT patient, namely further investigations, cognitive 
                            rehabilitation, non-pharmacologic approaches and pharmacologic 
                            interventions. This chapter focuses on the last - 
                            the pharmacologic - but all four areas are critical.</P>

                            evaluation, additional tests are based on the specific 
                            evaluation. Early on such tests as MRI, CT and routine 
                            sleep and wake electroencephalography plus supporting 
                            blood tests should be performed as indicated in the 
                            previous section (Neppe and Goodwin, in press). Changes 
                            in behavior should be carefully monitored as accurate 
                            diagnosis and evaluation is a key to appropriate management

                            important. The potential use of computers in this 
                            regard is an area in its infancy that will rapidly 
                            grow over the next decade. This is also not specifically

                            for the CHIT patient.</P>
                          <P align="left">1. DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS <BR>
                            Three regular meals per day are essential Vegetables 
                            and fruit are particularly useful. Avoid highly refined 
                            sugars such as candies Consideration of supplementation 
                            with Vitamins such as E, D, B6 and C or a complex 
                            of multivitamins is warranted. Even Vitamins can be 
                            toxic in high doses so appropriate dosing is important. 
                            Additionally, drug interactions can occur given the 
                            fat solubility of such vitamins as A, E and D. Avoid 
                            saccharins and nutrasweet until it is established 
                            that no specific behavioral effects occur correlating 
                            with these. Significant water intake is useful (hence 
                            the value of water filters) Plenty of exercise regulated 
                            appropriately by the primary care physician is valuable 
                            - graded aerobic elements</P>
                          <P align="left">2. HABITUAL CONSUMPTION CHANGE: <BR>
                            a. Cut down on any CAFFEINATED beverage consumption. 
                            Because of the presence of symptomatology which may 
                            in part be attributed to the caffeine intake, we recommend 
                            the patient to taper totally off beverages - coffee 
                            tea cola drinks - at the rate of 1 cup per day. Decaffeinated 
                            beverages can be taken as needed instead. Withdrawal 
                            effects such as caffeine withdrawal headache can be 
                            managed with acetaminophen and a slower taper of the 
                            caffeine.</P>
                          <P align="left">b. Cut down on any ALCOHOL. Besides 
                            direct effects, this will commonly interact with medications 
                            at one or more of four levels: absorption, altered 
                            metabolism, modified responsiveness at receptor levels 
                            and behavioral effects. Unless there are specific 
                            reasons, such as seizures triggered by a tot of wine, 
                            previous or current alcohol or drug difficulties or 
                            such predisposition, aggression or bizarre previous 
                            reactions to alcohol or driving, the occasional small 
                            amount of low potency alcohol (e.g. beer) or medium 
                            potency (e.g. wine) is acceptable.</P>
                          <P align="left">c. Clearly the use of any PLEASURE DRUGS 
                            of abuse should be avoided.</P>
                          <P align="left">d. Cut down on SMOKING. This can also 
                            be done using a slow taper. The availability of either 
                            Nicorette gum or Habitrol is a useful usable adjunct 
                            in this regard. Smoking withdrawal is commonly associated 
                            with weight gain and I have recommended that noncalorific 
                            fluids such as water be used instead; appropriate 
                            solids would be lentils, carrots and tomatoes which 
                            can be eaten instead. Moreover, changes in cigarette 
                            habit may result in different prescription needs because 
                            drug interactions or hepatic metabolism may change.</P>
                          <P align="left">3. PROPER HYGIENE: <BR>
                            a. ALLERGY: An air filter in home may be useful particularly 
                            in the context of any allergy history.</P>
                          <P align="left">b. BED AND SLEEP: The mattress should 
                            be good and firm; it should be turned regularly; The 
                            pillow should be comfortable; a neck pillow should 
                            be used in the event of neck pain. Any snoring should 
                            be taken seriously and this associated with any other 
                            features of possible sleep apnea, such as day time 
                            fatigue or periods of not breathing noted by others 
                            handled. The value of adequate temperature in the 
                            room - neither hot nor cold cannot be over-estimated. 
                            During winter, if greater fatigue or seasonal variations 
                            of mood arise, the use of a simple timer switch to 
                            create artificial light may be valuable; failing this 
                            more appropriate light therapy may be used, if necessary 
                            and severe enough.</P>
                          <P align="left">c. NECK A nodule vibrator or equivalent 
                            for the neck in the event of any neck pain may be 
                            useful.</P>
                          <P align="left">4. SPECIAL ISSUES: <BR>
                            a. MEMORY: Most so-called memory deficits have a significant 
                            functional component frequently relating to the non-specific 
                            symptoms of poor concentration. Valuable is the habit 
                            of recording information in a note-book to be carried 
                            around everywhere. This should include a list of To 
                            Do items and an address book. A cheap watch with multiple 
                            alarms is useful to ensure compliance with medications 
                            and relevant arrangements</P>
                          <P align="left">b. SPEECH: The use of computerized software 
                            (such as the program Word Foundry by Nordic software) 
                            may be useful for receptive or executive level mild 
                            aphasia. If the initial evaluation is suggestive of 
                            speech pathology, subtle elements could have been 
                            missed such as specific reading disability and an 
                            educational evaluation should be performed.</P>
                          <P align="left">c. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Express anger by using 
                            a punch bag. Exercise may be useful Loneliness may 
                            be alleviated by joining a social club. Write notes 
                            to self to express distress</P>
                          <P align="left">d. DRIVING: The operation of any motor 
                            or any other vehicle is always controversial. Most 
                            medications sedate somewhat and even those that do 
                            not may cause paradoxic reactions. On the other hand, 
                            certain conditions such as anxiety, day-time sleepiness, 
                            seizures, poor concentration or memory disturbance 
                            aggravate driving risk and the treatment may be assisting 
                            these problems. Extreme care should be used when driving, 
                            and even when it is deemed safe to drive short distances 
                            in familiar areas, it may be unsafe on longer or unfamiliar 
                            drives. Driving should be avoided in the event of 
                            doubt as to safety to drive not only on behalf of 
                            the patient but the family. Driving a car is always 
                            the ultimate responsibility of the individual driving 
                            it. The physician can advise in cases of uncertainty 
                            - frequently, medication control is safer than the 
                            untreated underlying condition, but any sedation or 
                            slowed reaction times or impaired consciousness or 
                            sleep, visual or memory impairment is a good reason 
                            not to drive.</P>
                          <P align="left">e. PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC SUPPORT Supportive 
                            psychotherapy with an appropriately trained therapist 
                            is useful. This should be directed at support with 
                            regard to current problems as well as allowing the 
                            patient a smoother transition as readjustments back 
                            to a healthy core occurs. Depth therapeutic probing, 
                            uncovering many layers of the patients psyche should 
                            be approached only with extreme caution as this may 
                            lead to further decompensation.</P>

                            avoided if at all possible.</P>

                                Two dose levels of dosage are useful - low e.g. 
                                5 mg t.i.d. which probably reflects autoreceptor 
                                raphe serotonergic nuclei effects; and high for 
                                considerable agitation and co-existing other symptoms 
                                e.g. 20 mg t.i.d. probably reflecting a predominantly 
                                serotonin 1A weak agonist effect. The low dose 
                                is based on the uncontrolled work of Neppe on 
                                non-organic patients and Ratey on mental retardates, 
                                the higher dose on Neppe's research. In many patients, 
                                we suggest initiating dosage at 5 mg t.i.d. built 
                                up gradually by increasing by 5 mg every 3 days 
                                to a initial aim level of 60 mg per day: if the 
                                patient develops non-vertiginous dizziness then 
                                drop the dose by 5 mg per day and continue the 
                                taper of dose until no dizziness occurs. Additionally, 
                                many CHIT patients reveal a predisposition towards 
                                obsessionality . Doses of e.g. 20mg t.i.d. probably 
                                reflect a predominantly serotonin 1A weak agonist 
                                effect and could be useful here - the only approved

                                A person is only epileptic when he has seizures 
                                recurrently. An epileptic seizure involves paroxysmal 
                                cerebral neuronal firing which may or may not 
                                produce disturbed consciousness and / or other 
                                perceptual or motor alterations (Neppe, 1988A, 
                                B). The most classical and common epileptic seizures 
                                are of the &quot;grand mal&quot; or generalized 
                                &quot;tonic - clonic&quot; kind. These usually 
                                involve relatively short (10-30 seconds) tonic 
                                movements with marked extension / flexion of muscles 
                                but no shaking and then a longer (15-60 sec) clonic 
                                tonic manifesting as rhythmic muscle group shaking. 
                                These movements may be associated with a phase 
                                of laryngeal stridor due to tonic muscles manifesting 
                                as a high pitched scream sound. Urinary and occasionally 
                                fecal incontinence may occur due to sphincteric 
                                change and the seizures are almost invariably 
                                followed by headache, sleepiness and / or confusion. 
                                When preceded by perceptual, autonomic, affective 
                                or cognitive alterations such seizures are secondarily 
                                generalized, as opposed to no original locus of 
                                firing producing focal features prior to the tonic 
                                clonic movements (generalized from the start) 
                                (Neppe, 1982 A ). The different epileptic seizures 
                                are classified in Table 1. 
                              <P align="left">Seizures or other paroxysmal neurobehavioral 
                                disturbances which may not qualify as seizures 
                                because the actual phenomena are not proven to 
                                be seizures are not insignificant post-traumatically. 
                                Until all variants are measured it would be difficult 
                                to estimate exact incidence. This is particularly 
                                so in the context of transient closed head injury. 
                                (CHIT) There is a dichotomy of the possibly 90% 
                                of epileptics who constitute the epilepsy standard 
                                patient who have no more psychopathology than 
                                the average patient and the epilepsy plus patient 
                                - a minority of epilepsy patients having behavioral 
                                or psychiatric abnormalities (Neppe, Tucker 1992). 
                                Seizure disorders present with a high incidence 
                                of behavioral disturbance, which may initially 
                                be interpreted as psychiatric in origin (Neppe, 
                                Tucker, 1989, 1994). Many of these relate to the 
                                temporal lobe of the brain. The features of temporal 
                                lobe epilepsy are so varied and so protean that 
                                it is necessary to classify them. Neppe has suggested 
                                the term &quot;possible temporal lobe symptoms&quot; 
                                (PTLSs) for this (Neppe, 1983 A). These are features 
                                which can be induced by stimulating areas of the 
                                temporal lobe during neurosurgery. These symptoms 
                                only become specific symptoms of temporal lobe 
                                dysfunction if their occurrence is validated empirically 
                                during a seizure - either through observation 
                                or by the electroencephalogram (hence the word 
                                &quot;possible&quot; in possible temporal lobe 
                                seizures) ( Table 2 ) (Neppe, 1983 B). Using a 
                                phenomenological analysis, Neppe was able to demonstrate 
                                that the symptom of deja vu commonly regarded 
                                as symptomatic of temporal lobe epilepsy indeed 
                                had a very special phenomenologic quality in patients 
                                with temporal lobe epilepsy (Neppe, 1983 A, 1983C 
                                ). This involves its association with post-ictal 
                                features such as sleepiness, headache and clouded 
                                consciousness and its link in time with these 
                                features. This association provides an excellent 
                                clue to the existence of temporal lobe epilepsy. 
                                Deja vu is a normal phenomenon occurring in 70 
                                percent of the population and unless such phenomenological 
                                detail is obtained, patients' symptomatology may 
                                be misinterpreted. Neppe has similarly done such 
                                a study with olfactory hallucinations (Neppe, 
                                1983 B, D, 1982 B). A specific type of temporal 
                                lobe epilepsy olfactory hallucination could not 
                                be demonstrated although there were suggestive 
                                features (Neppe, 1984B). A major message, therefore, 
                                may be the relevance of adequately assessing the 
                                symptomatology of patients presenting with epilepsy. 
                                It may be that this is a direction as relevant 
                                as electroencephalographic monitoring (Neppe, 
                                1993 B). <BR>

                                Kindling may be relevant in head injury. Generally 
                                several events would be required to trigger such 
                                a phenomenon but CHIT theoretically may the straw 
                                that broke the camel's back. We discuss kindling 
                                briefly below. 
                              <P align="left">Kindling involves the progression 
                                of increasingly severe seizure manifestations 
                                in response to electrical stimuli of various areas 
                                of the brain such as the hippocampus, amygdala, 
                                pyriform cortex, or basal ganglia. Such stimulation 
                                is initially sub-threshold, but becomes threshold 
                                when administered repetitively. These sub-threshold 
                                changes, which have been demonstrated in numerous 
                                animal species, at times manifest with behavioral 
                                changes sometimes preceding the motor seizures 
                                (Neppe, 1985A,B,C). Neppe recognized that there 
                                are distinct biochemical and other differences 
                                between so-called electrical kindling and the 
                                chemical induction of the process and so developed 
                                the term chindling for the chemical induction 
                                of increasingly severe seizure manifestations 
                                in response to general chemical stimuli (Neppe, 
                                1989 B). 
                              <P align="left">Kindling is increasingly difficult 
                                to induce with the added degrees of encephalization 
                                in primates. If, indeed, the kindling phenomenon 
                                occurs in man, it would probably take many years. 
                                There is indirect evidence for its occurrence 
                                in the development of mirror foci, generalization 
                                of seizures, the alcohol withdrawal paradigm, 
                                and possibly paradigms of response pertaining 
                                to nonresponsive psychosis (Tucker, Neppe, 1988, 
                                1991). However, kindling has become a very useful 
                                theoretical concept to rationalize interventions 
                                pertaining to adjunctive drugs, particularly anticonvulsants. 
                                Whether or not kindling is shown to be an artifact 
                                or not is probably not of vital importance, for 
                                its role may be as a stimulant to further research.

                                The preferential anticonvulsants in this instance 
                                are not necessarily for a seizure indication, 
                                per se. The subpopulation of CHIT being treated 
                                is the focal residual group. They may manifest 
                                with frank post-traumatic seizures, however, they 
                                may have atypical spells manifesting as the various 
                                kinds of episodic events that we have called paroxysmal 
                                neurobehavioral disorder (PND). Diagnosis is based 
                                clinically, on EEG and on anticonvulsant responsiveness. 
                              <P align="left">The management of epileptics presenting 
                                with behavior disturbance is closely linked to 
                                the discussion of epilepsy in relation to psychopathology. 
                                The heterogeneity of such conditions implies a 
                                heterogeneity of management which is patient based 
                                and individually tailored (Neppe, 1988). 
                              <P align="left">The most important single principle 
                                is anticonvulsant monotherapy. It has been well 
                                demonstrated that the degree of seizure control 
                                is not increased by increasing the number of anticonvulsant 
                                medications. (Neppe, Tucker 1988 A, B) It is more 
                                important to achieve adequate anticonvulsant dosage 
                                and therapeutic ranges on blood levels are often 
                                helpful indicators. However, the object should 
                                be to adequately control all the patient's seizures 
                                and the choice of anticonvulsant is equally important. 
                                Management of patients with seizure disorders 
                                involves primarily appropriate use of anticonvulsants 
                                (Neppe, Tucker, 1988B). In addition, counseling 
                                and the various aspects of psychosocial support, 
                                allowing the patient to live as normal a life 
                                as possible, and to be supported within the framework 
                                of the environment, is also important. 
                              <P align="left">a. CARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol) is the 
                                primary drug in this group for the CHIT indication 
                                as it seems to have a specific psychotropic effect. 
                                We use it predominantly in the context of temporal 
                                lobe phenomena. It should not to be generically 
                                substituted (Neppe et al, 1988C ). The carbamazepine 
                                in this instance can be used for the approved 
                                usage of relieving seizure disorders or any incidental 
                                neuralgia and sometimes fibromyalgia (unapproved 
                                and unproven). In seizures, the anticonvulsant 
                                effect comes into play. The usual dose for seizures 
                                are 200-400 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. based on monitoring 
                                serum levels to 8-12 ug/ 100 ml and clinical responsiveness 
                                and we have found usually slightly lower doses 
                                to be adequate in atypical spells, PND and temporal 
                                lobe dysfunction e.g. 200 mg tid.

                                correspond with an initial target dose of 200 
                                mg t.i.d. The low dose is based on the double 
                                blind controlled work of Neppe on patients with 
                                EEG temporal lobe abnormalities and refractory

                                (DEPAKOTE - not a generic) may be useful particularly 
                                with residual focal frontal lobe phenomena. The

                                dose of 250 mg t.i.d. is suggested. The usual

                                serum levels are unnecessary and unavailable. 
                                Technically, it too is an adjunctive anticonvulsant, 
                                but it may be tried in monotherapy for specific 
                                symptoms. Doses of 25 mg daily built up to 100-200 
                                mg bid over several weeks are average.

                                Topiramate comes in 25 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg sizes. 
                                Begin with 25 mg bid and build if necessary to 
                                up to 400 mg daily. Tiagabine has small milligram

                                and the usual dosage of 12 through 40 mg per day. 
                                Both drugs are useful as adjunctive therapy in

                                Sleep disorders <BR>
                                One of the most common complaints after CHIT is 
                                sleep disturbance which may take months or years 
                                to fully improve. Many such complaints may be 
                                psychiatrically linked, however, some may have 
                                biological bases, linked with the conditions above. 
                                Sleep disorders are among the most fundamental 
                                of all psychiatric disorders, and certain psychiatric 
                                illnesses may well have a very profound base with 
                                regard to sleep disturbance. For example, a diagnosis 
                                of mania may be nearly impossible without a profound 
                                decrease in total sleep time and, in fact, most 
                                manics have a period of at least 36 hours where 
                                they do not sleep at all and during which they 
                                do not feel fatigued (Tucker, Neppe, 1988) Similarly, 
                                a shift with phase advance and a decreased latency 
                                to rapid eye movement sleep is characteristic 
                                of a biological depression. Another common symptom 
                                in this condition is terminal insomnia - early 
                                morning waking. This may or may not be correlated 
                                with this phase advancement as the two have not 
                                been investigated (Tucker, Neppe, 1988). 
                              <P align="left">Sleep disturbance is of profound 
                                importance in the CHIT but may reflect underlying 
                                affective disorder or personality. Many patients 
                                with profound degrees of antisocial personality 
                                give a history of sleep disturbance involving 
                                paroxysmal wakenings since childhood. Many brain 
                                impaired individuals may have periods during which 
                                they nap during the day.

                                by head injury with or without patients with traumatic 
                                temporal lobe epilepsy (Neppe, Tucker 1994) and 
                                head trauma (Neppe, Tucker 1994; Tucker, Neppe 
                                1991). 
                              <P align="left">We believe that CHIT may trigger

                                with limited cerebral reserve (MacAllister, 1983, 
                                1992). This refers to the organic symptomatology, 
                                particularly dementing symptoms in affectively

                                in dealing with the demented patient, one must

                                OTHERS - choice is optional): occasionally lithium 
                                is useful when patients manifest cyclical phenomena 
                                of their residual focal CHIT. Medication problems 
                                with lithium are linked commonly to tremor which 
                                is a rather coarse static one which patients find 
                                impairing in functionality and embarrassing. Some 
                                patients become nauseous and/ or confused. Our 
                                preference is to lower dosage in the event of 
                                any of the above symptoms. Baseline blood tests 
                                of electrolytes and renal functions are important 
                                as is frequent monitoring for a major but neglected 
                                long-term complication nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
                                commonly presenting as polyuria or nocturia. One 
                                way to initiate lithium is by giving 600 mg on 
                                the first day and check a level after 24 hours. 
                                This will also screen for those who become Lithium 
                                toxic rather quickly. Lithium is an extremely 
                                lethal compound and should be used under supervision 
                                of a psychiatrist. Two different blood levels 
                                can be considered: Low dose with less side-effect 
                                potential but possibly less control: aim at a 
                                blood level of 0.4-0.6 meq / L. High dose with 
                                more side-effect potential but possibly more control: 
                                aim at a blood level of 0.7-0.9 meq / L. Many 
                                colleagues use higher doses but this would not 
                                be my preference in this instance.

                                norepinephrine and serotonin receptor levels. 
                                Bupropion may also be of value. 
                              <P align="left">b.1. NEFAZODONE (Serzone): This 
                                antidepressant of triazolopyridine structure has 
                                ideal theoretical elements both for agitated and 
                                retarded depression. The reason relates to its 
                                modulating SSRI properties which implies less 
                                side-effects such as agitation, anxiety, sexual 
                                related pathology, nausea, akathisia and suicidality. 
                                It has additionally serotonin 2 blocking effects 
                                which should enhance both antidepressant and anti-aggressive 
                                properties and further diminish SSRI side-effects. 
                                It is more sedative than the other SSRIs but far 
                                less than the triazolopyridine, Trazodone. My 
                                preference is to start with doses of 50 mg bid 
                                and increase every 3 days by 50 mg daily, always 
                                giving bid dosing until an initial dose of 200 
                                mg bid is achieved. Doses should best be given 
                                in the morning and afternoon because of its short 
                                half life and uneven kinetics. Costs of all sizes 
                                are equal - 200 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg. Serzone 
                                inhibits the 3A4 part of Cytochrome P450 enzyme 
                                system in the liver. This increases levels of 
                                certain chemicals e.g. ketoconazole, alprazolam, 
                                triazolam, and probably SSRIs like fluoxetine 
                                as well as some calcium channel blockers. These 
                                substances should increase Nefazodone levels as 
                                well and a 50% dose adjustment is general rule. 
                                Particularly, do not give with Seldane (terfenadine) 
                                and Hismanal (astemizole) - if necessary change 
                                to Claritin (Loratadine) (10 mg Claritin usually 
                                equal to 10 mg Hismanal, 60 mg bid of Seldane) 
                              <P align="left">b.2. Venlafaxine (Effexor) This 
                                has the advantage of acting at both serotonin

                                (&quot;chisel&quot; and more physiologic) and

                                SSRIs. Its limitations relate to possible nausea, 
                                escalated blood pressure and agitation. It is 
                                logical in the retarded depressive patient.

                                antidepressant likely acts clinically through

                                thought. Bupropion differs from most antidepressants 
                                in its absence of effect on serotonin. Given the 
                                availability of a long-acting form, twice daily 
                                dosing is logical with a starting dose of 75 mg 
                                twice per day building if necessary to 300 mg 
                                daily. Likely choice is based on amotivation,

                                antidepressants are not usually recommended in 
                                the CHIT patient with depression, but are commonly 
                                prescribed by some - the tricyclic antidepressant 
                                and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor 
                                groups. I. Tricyclic antidepressants like nortriptyline, 
                                imipramine and desipramine. The tricyclic group 
                                has problematic side-effects namely potential 
                                epileptogenicity, memory impairments, cardiotoxicity 
                                due to arrhythmias, anticholinergic effects such

                                sedation. In the CHIT patient, the dysmnesic and 
                                seizure elements are particularly troublesome.

                                medication. This tricyclic antidepressant is potent 
                                and can be used frequently in doses of 75 mg per

                                allows easy evaluation particularly in the complex 
                                patient on carbamazepine. Its effects are predominantly 
                                serotonergic.

                                the anticholinergic nor cardiotoxic side-effects 
                                of the tricyclic antidepressants. However, they 
                                are potent serotonergic agonists with no way to

                                There is a possible discontinuation syndrome,

                                not recommend the SSRIs to the CHIT patient. The 
                                serotonergic effects of all the current SSRIs 
                                appear non-specific on supposedly all serotonin 
                                receptor subtypes. As such, the risk of paradoxic 
                                reactions is theoretically higher.

                                and / or a history of paradoxic responses. These 
                                drugs should be used with caution based on potential

                                possible tachyphylactic effects. One approach 
                                is to use these drugs in both attention deficit

                                Disorders and Head injury <BR>
                                There are many neurologic causes of psychosis 
                                (Table 1), particularly seizure disorders and 
                                more so complex partial seizures (or temporal 
                                lobe epilepsy). This may be a possible link of 
                                the rare onset of paranoid psychosis after brief 
                                traumatic brain injury. In 1963, Slater and Beard 
                                pointed out that all of the symptoms that have 
                                been observed in schizophrenic patients can occur 
                                in patients with seizure disorders. Recent efforts 
                                using standardized diagnostic rating scales have 
                                shown that the positive symptoms of the psychotic 
                                state of patients with temporal lobe seizure disorders 
                                is almost identical to schizophrenics (Trimble, 
                                1982; Toone, 1981). Seizure disorders present 
                                with a high incidence of behavioral disturbance, 
                                which may initially be interpreted as psychiatric 
                                in origin (Neppe, Tucker, 1994). The range of 
                                behavioral symptoms is listed in Table II and 
                                most patients have only one or two of these symptoms 
                                that remain consistent over the course of the 
                                illness. (Neppe, 1989 D) 
                              <P align="left">NEUROLEPTICS (antipsychotics; also 
                                called major tranquilizers) should be avoided 
                                in the head injured as there is a higher risk 
                                of tardive dyskinesia (Neppe, Holden, 1989; Neppe 
                                1989 D). Exceptions relate to the very occasional 
                                presence of or exacerbation of psychosis. PERPHENAZINE 
                                (TRILAFON) medication has become our preferential 
                                drug in post-traumatic psychosis as part of the 
                                residual focal elements of the CHIT. Perphenazine 
                                is approved for use in psychotic conditions. Amongst 
                                the important side-effects discussed is the long 
                                term risk of tardive dyskinesia and related syndromes 
                                and its relevance to diagnosis, dosage, duration 
                                of treatment, smoking epidemiology and the limited 
                                amounts of treatment. Anticholinergic medication 
                                is sometimes prescribed to alleviate the extra-pyramidal 
                                side-effects of neuroleptic drugs. The patient 
                                should not routinely receive anticholinergic agent 
                                with the perphenazine as this complicates pharmacokinetics, 
                                may accentuate psychosis, is usually unnecessary 
                                and disputably increases the risk of tardive dyskinesia. 
                                Additionally, anticholinergics mask neuroleptic 
                                dosage somewhat. Also, additional potential side-effects 
                                of dry mouth, dilated pupils with blurring of 
                                vision, constipation, confusion, memory impairment 
                                and delirium may occur (Neppe, Ward, 1989). When 
                                there is a previous history of response to anticholinergics 
                                but with side-effects of sedation, an anticholinergic 
                                which is relatively non-sedative, has low abuse 
                                potential, and which moreover has some muscle 
                                relaxant effect, orphenadrine (Norflex) is recommended. 
                                Usual doses are 50 mg TID. If not tolerated, lower 
                                doses can be tried. A maximum of 100 mg tid should 
                                be used. The most commonly used anti-Parkinsonian 
                                anticholinergic in the USA appears to be benztropine 
                                (Cogentin).
