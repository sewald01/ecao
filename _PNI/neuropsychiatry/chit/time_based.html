                          <H2>The Time Based Neuropsychiatric Evaluation</H2>
                          <P align="left"> Simply stated, the time based evaluation 
                            presupposes that traditional evaluation procedures 
                            may not always be sufficient in properly understanding 
                            the etiology and manifestations of the CHITS. The 
                            traditional neuropsychiatri$ evaluation has routinely 
                            consisted of a diagnostic interview process, review 
                            of background information, mental status examination 
                            and possibly some lab testing. This is often accomplished 
                            in a single session or over two sessions with the 
                            patient. If predominant cognitive sequelae exist, 
                            a referral to a neuropsychologist is often made. </P>
                          <P align="left"> The neuropsychologist or neuropsychiatrist 
                            in turn completes another one time clinical interview, 
                            administers a battery of neuropsychological tests, 
                            reviews available medical and other pertinent records, 
                            and forms a clinical impression based on this limited 
                            time with the patient. At times, there may be additional 
                            collateral information obtained from significant others, 
                            usually obtained during a single session. </P>
                          <P align="left"> This traditional process of evaluation 
                            gives the clinician a sample of the patients physical, 
                            cognitive and psychological behavior that is essentially 
                            a snapshot view much like the instant results obtained 
                            from the Polaroid picture. The information obtained 
                            from this snapshot approach gives the clinician a 
                            small slice of how the patient is functioning at a 
                            given point in time. This represents a very limited 
                            sample of the patients behavior. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Yet as health care providers, we continue 
                            to evaluate patients with CHITs in this way and we 
                            make inferential leaps and generalizations affecting 
                            our conclusions and our recommendations. While this 
                            approach may be sufficient in assessing many clinical 
                            syndromes, it can lead to many false positives and 
                            false negatives within the population of head trauma 
                            patients. The current data base of research findings 
                            and multidisciplinary clinical experience would suggest 
                            that this snapshot approach does not give the evaluator 
                            enough information to clearly understand the dynamics 
                            presented in many patients with CHIT. </P>
                          <P align="left"> There are obviously many cases of CHIT 
                            where the findings derived from a single snapshot 
                            approach to evaluation will be sufficient to make 
                            appropriate recommendations. However, clinical experience 
                            has shown that there is often a need to defer final 
                            clinical impression until the clinician has had more 
                            time with the patient. This is encountered frequently 
                            among clinicians who work with the head injured patient 
                            on a daily basis. </P>
                          <P align="left"> When clinicians begin the evaluation 
                            process with a patient, we often make underlying assumptions 
                            with respect to the patients abilities as a historian. 
                            We usually collect our data directly from the patients 
                            report. We fail to realize that with patients experiencing 
                            head trauma symptoms, there is usually a diminished 
                            ability to be aware of ones self and insight is often 
                            reduced. Furthermore, there are concurrent deficits 
                            in expressive speech that limit the patient in their 
                            attempt to completely express the full range of their 
                            ideas and recollections about their functioning. These 
                            patients almost always complain of difficulty expressing 
                            their thoughts and ideas and formulating a self-analysis 
                            of their behavior. When the very part of us as human 
                            beings that we refer to as &quot;self&quot; is experienced 
                            as changed because of underlying pathophysiological 
                            disruption, it is difficult to fully appreciate the 
                            meaning and effects of this change, let alone try 
                            to express this clearly and cogently during the brief 
                            time period of diagnostic interviewing. We must always 
                            remember that when we refer to head trauma we are 
                            also referring to trauma to the mind and its ability 
                            to experience and cope with the after effects of the 
                            trauma and in turn communicate these after effects 
                            to health care providers. </P>
                          <P align="left"> When these patients present their complex 
                            constellation of physical, cognitive and psychological 
                            changes following head trauma, the clinician needs 
                            to give them the time to render a comprehensive self 
                            report. Because of diminished awareness and insight, 
                            a patient may not be able to fully convey the qualitative 
                            aspects of their complaints. They also may not be 
                            able to remember everything they need to tell the 
                            provider. Memory problems are typically one of the 
                            chief complaints in the CHIT syndrome. This makes 
                            it difficult for patients to organize and recall their 
                            experience of changes in their perception of self. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> With a time based approach, we interact 
                            with the patient over a number of sessions allowing 
                            for the time to obtain a film strip version of the 
                            patients experiences, symptoms and complaints. This 
                            approach minimizes the tendency to over or under diagnose 
                            and increases the validity and reliability of the 
                            data collected from the diagnostic interviewing. </P>
                          <P align="left"> The clinician gathers data from a variety 
                            of the patients life experiences over time and establishes 
                            greater validity to the spectrum of symptomatology. 
                            Patterns of symptoms and complaints become clearer 
                            as the patient interacts within their familial, social 
                            and occupational environment over the course of days 
                            and weeks. The health care provider begins to obtain 
                            a time based sample from the diverse topography of 
                            everyday life. This topographic elicitation of symptom 
                            manifestation within the context of the patients personal 
                            ecology of life circumstances gives a three dimensional 
                            perspective of symptomatology over time, across situations, 
                            and within different environments. We refer to this 
                            as a time based topographic validity. More simply 
                            stated, this validity is based on the presupposition 
                            that there is no substitute for time when it comes 
                            to case formulation of the dynamics involved in CHIT. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Over the course of time spent with 
                            the patient, we advocate utilizing a variety of assessment 
                            procedures to attempt to substantiate the patterns 
                            of physical, cognitive and psychological problems 
                            being presented. </P>
                          <P align="left"> In essence, premorbid and predisposing 
                            features are often missed with single evaluations. 
                            Undetected problems are regarded as not existing instead 
                            of not diagnosed because evaluations are too short. 
                            In some instances, particular conditions are especially 
                            undiagnosed: in our experience, many have CPSzs which 
                            remain undetected and moreover false reassurance by 
                            practitioners doing such single or cursory evaluations 
                            ultimately may harm the patient: the condition is 
                            not diagnosed and the patient regards his/ her symptoms 
                            as psychological when there is a good physical base. 
                            Moreover, sometimes when symptoms have persisted over 
                            months, the patient is investigated neuroradiologically 
                            and when no positive findings are found, this is in 
                            error could be regarded as proof of the post-traumatic 
                            syndrome etiology and the absence of organicity. In 
                            actuality, invariably changes which may have been 
                            detected neuroradiologically early on in the first 
                            month, no longer can be found and this implies not 
                            psychological etiology but incorrect timing of the 
                            neuroradiologic evaluation. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Finally, we emphasize the real world 
                            approach, Neuropsychological testing in a quiet office, 
                            with encouragement and one on one testing with one 
                            single task at a time may be insensitive to the subtle 
                            changes that a bustling office of multitasked demands 
                            may bring. Many people require such multitasking in 
                            their regular occupation e.g. physicians. </P>
