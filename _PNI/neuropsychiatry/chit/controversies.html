                          <H1>Controversies of mild traumatic brain injury</H1>
                          <P align="left"> The experimental and scientific understanding 
                            of mild traumatic head injury (MTHI) has evolved over 
                            the past twenty years, with a plethora of research 
                            being generated and documented within the scientific 
                            literature. At the same time, clinical experience 
                            across multidisciplinary lines has increased as health 
                            care professionals have continued to interact with 
                            this population of patients. It has recently been 
                            estimated that approximately two million people annually 
                            in the United States experience closed head injury 
                            (Brown, &amp; Fann, 1994). Closed head injury represents 
                            a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially 
                            within the younger populations. This has resulted 
                            in a considerable increase in health problems associated 
                            with the residual sequelae of closed head injury. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Epidemiological studies have documented 
                            that within the incidence of closed head injury in 
                            general, injuries that are classified as mild or minor 
                            typically account for the greater percentage of cases 
                            evaluated in emergency room and out patient settings 
                            (Goodwin, 1989). This is also the case outside the 
                            United States, where estimates range as high as eighty 
                            percent (Cohadon, Richer, &amp; Castel, 1991). </P>
                          <P align="left"> While the current body of research 
                            literature and experience from clinical practice has 
                            provided a greater understanding of MTHI, there continues 
                            to be controversy with respect to definition and classification 
                            (Kibby, &amp; Long, 1996). Any approach for neuropsychiatric 
                            and/or neuropsychological evaluation of MTHI must 
                            take into account the confusion that exists in understanding 
                            this injury as it is differentiated from more severe 
                            injuries and from other neuropsychiatric disorders. 
                            Earlier attempts at defining the parameters of MTHI 
                            have been seen in the research literature (Colohan, 
                            Dacey, Alves Rimel, Jane, 1986, Davidoff, Kessler, 
                            Laibstain, &amp; Mark, 1988). The Mild Traumatic Brain 
                            Injury Committee of the Head Injury Interdisciplinary 
                            Special Interest Group of the American Congress of 
                            Rehabilitation Medicine has proposed definitive guidelines, 
                            which have been utilized by the research community 
                            in more recent studies (Kay, et al, 1993). More current 
                            proposals for classification of the spectrum of MTHI 
                            have also been suggested (Esselman &amp; Uomoto, 1995). 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Despite the clearer definitive guidelines, 
                            there continues to be clinical confusion in evaluating 
                            and understanding the pathophysiology, symptomatology, 
                            and differential diagnosis of MTHI. The use of the 
                            terms postconcussive syndrome (PCS)and posttraumatic 
                            syndrome (PTS) has been used to describe the pattern 
                            of symptom presentation seen in this population of 
                            patients. However, this has not led to a clearer understanding 
                            of MTHI with respect to evaluation and assessment. 
                            In addition, there have been suggestions that mild 
                            head injuries should be differentiated from mild brain 
                            injuries. Furthermore, there is often the development 
                            of secondary psychiatric disorders that may have a 
                            physiological and/or psychosocioenvironmental basis, 
                            typically referred to among clinicians as psychological 
                            overlay, that complicate the clinical presentation 
                            of MTHI and make the evaluative process more complex. 
                          </P>
                          <P align="left"> Clearly, the greatest scientific and 
                            clinical controversy has been associated with the 
                            postconcussive nomenclature (Binder, 1986, Lowden, 
                            Briggs &amp; Cockin, 1989, Alves, Macciocchi, &amp; 
                            Barth, 1993, Kibby &amp; Long, 1996). In general, 
                            PCS has been understood to represent the synergistic 
                            and interactive effects of physical, cognitive and 
                            psychological symptoms seen upon clinical presentation. 
                            The assumption is made that there may be physiologic, 
                            pharmacologic, psychologic, socioenvironmental, circumstantial, 
                            and medicolegal bases underlying the perpetuation 
                            of symptomatology. There is also typically a presentation 
                            of chronic pain syndrome that may have both physical 
                            and psychological factors contributing to the pattern 
                            of symptoms and complaints. Neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological 
                            evaluation of these patients presents the clinician 
                            with a complex task of deciding how to explain the 
                            nature of PCS and more importantly what to recommend 
                            with respect to treatment. </P>
                          <P align="left"> There is also disagreement among researchers 
                            and clinicians as to the duration of PCS and what 
                            factors predispose individuals to developing a persistent 
                            PCS. Within this context, the issue of premorbid factors 
                            such as personality characteristics, past psychiatric 
                            history, previous substance abuse, prior incidence 
                            of MTHI, and general health problems certainly appears 
                            to have an influence on the chronicity of symptoms 
                            (Goodwin, 1989). </P>
                          <P align="left"> Because of the confounding issues inherent 
                            in the diagnostic assessment of the MTHI patient, 
                            a comprehensive time based neuropsychiatric evaluation 
                            is proposed to clinically deal with the complexities 
                            seen in this patient population. Such a time based 
                            evaluation process may not always be necessary, but 
                            in cases where there are confusing diagnostic differentials, 
                            a time based approach will be helpful in guiding the 
                            clinician through the evaluation process. The time 
                            based approach will be presented later on in this 
                            chapter. </P>
                          <P align="left"> We further propose a neuropsychiatric 
                            nomenclature and classification based on the practical 
                            aspects of evaluation, which are more meaningful to 
                            the clinician in everyday practice. These clinical 
                            distinctions should not be considered distinct entities, 
                            but rather as clinical aspects of a dynamic post head 
                            trauma spectrum that can be useful in guiding the 
                            clinician in the evaluation process. We will attempt 
                            to integrate current research findings and clinical 
                            experience into a methodology for neuropsychiatric 
                            evaluation that is first of all useful to the patient 
                            and secondly reflects clinical acumen and multiclinical 
                            diversity. </P>
