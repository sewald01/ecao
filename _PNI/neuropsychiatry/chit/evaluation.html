                            Evaluation in CHIT. It includes several time based 
                            interviews allowing a longitudinal perspective with 
                            several cross-sectional views including Detailed History;

                          <P align="left">In general the following order is followed:</P>
                          <P align="left"> On the first meeting, the major focus 
                            is the main complaint, focus of referral, a detailed 
                            pharmacologic history, history of investigations and 
                            of associated features.</P>
                          <P align="left"> On the second meeting more details 
                            about medical history are obtained, as well as physical 
                            and neurologic examination. </P>
                          <P align="left"> The third evaluation includes integration

                          <P align="left"> The fourth evaluation stresses recommendations 
                            and pharmacologic treatment options and also included 
                            feed-back. </P>
                          <P align="left"> Further consultations have a focus 
                            on symptom and etiology removal through psychopharmacologic 
                            integration and / or responsiveness as well as any 
                            further details pertaining to tests or clinical information

                            report is produced reflecting historical data, medical 
                            evaluation, examination of higher brain functions 
                            and investigation information. This allows for a detailed 
                            multi-axial neuropsychiatric diagnosis and a road-map 
                            for present and future management both pharmacologic 
                            and non-pharmacologic. To facilitate the report being 
                            properly read, whereas all areas may be important, 
                            areas in italics or emboldened as well as table sections 
                            on investigations, pharmacology and diagnosis and 
                            the recommendations headers allow quicker initial 
                            perspective on our findings. </P>

                                used was the Neppe Temporal Lobe Questionnaire

                                upon the temporal lobe. This was later revised 
                                to a new instrument which we routinely use on 
                                all patients namely, The <B>INVENTORY OF NEPPE 
                                OF SYMPTOMS OF EPILEPSY AND THE TEMPORAL LOBE 
                                (INSET )</B>. This is a paper and pencil test 
                                and amplified by a detailed face-to-face interview. 
                                The INSET involves screening for possible temporal 
                                lobe, epileptic and organic symptoms and spells. 
                                Thereafter the symptoms are categorized into several

                                and controversial temporal lobe symptoms, seizure 
                                related and other focal features. The test is

                              One is the <B>Neppe narcolepsy screen</B> which 
                              has not been well researched. Narcolepsy is a rare 
                              condition itself (incidence possibly 1 in several 
                              thousand individuals). However, the questionnaire 
                              is far more versatile probing sleep disturbance 
                              as well as anomalistic experiences and these are 
                              common in the CHIT patient. Unfortunately, the questionnaire 
                              needs to be scored by paper and pencil at this stage 
                              and there are no norms so that although highly relevant 
                              history information is obtained at a clinical level, 
                              a clinician needs to interpret the results. </P>

                              Questionnaires</B> are other screening history instruments 
                              seldom used in clinical practice. However, the major 
                              value of this well validated instrument is to demonstrate 
                              how we cannot interpret symptoms not elicited in 
                              detail as the same. Using a phenomenological analysis, 
                              Neppe was able to demonstrate that the symptom of 
                              d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, commonly regarded as symptomatic 
                              of temporal lobe epilepsy indeed had a very special 
                              phenomenologic quality in patients with temporal 
                              lobe epilepsy (Neppe, 1983A). This involves its 
                              association with post-ictal features such as sleepiness, 
                              headache and clouded consciousness and its link 
                              in time with these features. This association provides 
                              an excellent clue to the existence of temporal lobe 
                              epilepsy but d&eacute;j&agrave; vu is a normal phenomenon 
                              occurring in 70 percent of the population and unless 
                              such phenomenological detail is obtained, patients' 
                              symptomatology may be misinterpreted (Neppe, 1983 
                              A). Neppe has similarly done such a study with olfactory 
                              hallucinations (Neppe, 1983 B, 1984). A specific 
                              type of temporal lobe epilepsy olfactory hallucination 
                              could not be demonstrated although there were suggestive 
                              features. </P>

                              to more formal standardized evaluations. Routinely 
                              at our institute, we evaluate patients using two 
                              computerized psychological instruments - The MMPI 
                              or its adolescent version - and the Symptom Check 
                              List 90. There is strong support to use personality 
                              evaluations and some would debate the Millon Clinical 
                              Multiaxial Inventory (MMCI) should be used instead 
                              of or in addition to the MMPI. We believe it useful 
                              to screen current psychological symptoms hence the 
                              use of the SCL 90. We do not find this an ideal 
                              instrument and recognize its significant limitations 
                              both in lack of detail and selectivity of questions. 
                              Both these tests are not well standardized in the 
                              brain injured populations but with the INSET and 
                              other organic screens (e.g. BROCAS SCAN below) we 
                              believe they are valuable. We have also considered 
                              adding the SCID to our instrumentation. We precede 
                              the test discussions with some background. </P>

                            <P align="left"> Within the head trauma population, 
                              perhaps the area that is the most difficult to understand 
                              for both patient and provider, and often the most 
                              complex, is the assessment of personality. Early 
                              research in this area (Thomsen, 1974) revealed that 
                              families of head trauma patients reported changes 
                              in personality to be more of a burden to them than 
                              residual physical problems. Goethe and Levin (1984) 
                              conclude that family complaints about head injured 
                              patients center around personality and behavior 
                              changes rather than physical disabilities, and family 
                              tensions typically increase as time goes even up 
                              to two years following an injury. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Assessing potential changes in personality 
                              obviously cannot be accomplished properly within 
                              an hour or hour and a half diagnostic interview 
                              with the patient. Understanding the subtle yet complex 
                              changes that can occur in personality dynamics following 
                              head trauma is primarily the basis for advocating 
                              a time based evaluation process. Far too often misdiagnosis 
                              is made with respect to the presence or absence 
                              of personality disorders. As clinicians, we simply 
                              need to humble ourselves and not be so quick to 
                              make clinical judgments based on limited time with 
                              the patient. </P>
                            <P align="left"> From the time period of the 1970s 
                              through the 1980s the epidemiological, neurological 
                              and neuropsychological evaluation of minor traumatic 
                              head injury has produced a greater awareness of 
                              the changes that can occur in intellectual and cognitive 
                              functioning (OHara, 1988). Within the last five 
                              to ten years there has continued to be research 
                              generated on the definitions and neuropsychological 
                              aspects of minor head trauma (Kibby &amp; Long, 
                              1996, Esselman &amp; Uomoto, 1995, Cohadon, Richer, 
                              &amp; Castel, 1991, Alves, Macciocchi &amp; Barth, 
                              1993, Lowdon, Briggs, &amp; Cockin, 1989). There 
                              has however, been much less research and clinical 
                              literature written on the neuropsychiatric aspects 
                              of head trauma. McAllister (1992) discusses neuropsychiatric 
                              sequelae of head trauma in terms of pathophysiology, 
                              cognitive sequelae, behavior, effects of age, and 
                              treatment. Also within the past five years, studies 
                              emphasizing personality issues following head trauma 
                              have increased our awareness of the need to understand 
                              this aspect of the head trauma spectrum (Middleboe, 
                              Birket-Smith, Anderson, &amp; Friis, 1992, Miller, 
                              1992). There is a great need within the health profession 
                              to appreciate the subtle, yet significant changes 
                              in personality that can occur with head trauma, 
                              and to get beyond the purely clinical aspects of 
                              assessing these changes to recognize the trauma 
                              to the self. Clinicians who work day in and day 
                              out with head trauma patients will attest to the 
                              difficulties these patients experience when their 
                              equilibrium of self has been altered by trauma and 
                              brain injury. </P>
                            <P align="left"> In addressing this issue, it must 
                              be reiterated again that to fully evaluate these 
                              changes in personality takes time. Initially, the 
                              patient is often preoccupied with problems with 
                              pain and they are not yet aware of changes in themselves. 
                              As recovery progresses, there is more awareness 
                              of the cognitive and psychological problems. When 
                              patients begin to feel better physically, they attempt 
                              to get back in the swing of things and this is usually 
                              the time period when they begin to notice that they 
                              do not feel the same. As cognitive sequelae resolve, 
                              they return to work and reintegrate into social 
                              and leisure activities. However, continued reduction 
                              in tolerance, irritability, emotional volatility, 
                              and mental and emotional fatigue are experienced 
                              on a daily basis. </P>
                            <P align="left"> These subtle residuals are typically 
                              difficult to assess in the clinical setting. Yet, 
                              time spent with these patients will often reveal 
                              the struggle they experience in trying to cope with 
                              everyday life. They are constantly reminded by the 
                              difficulties they encounter that they have changed 
                              and that they feel different. There is often a longing 
                              to be like they used to be and get their life back 
                              to what it used to be. But the truth of the matter 
                              is that many of these patients will never regain 
                              the old self and be able to capture the sense of 
                              being who they were. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Patients with more dysfunctional 
                              personality styles often develop secondary psychiatric 
                              problems, which can considerably complicate the 
                              clinical picture. This psychological overlay is 
                              often misjudged by inexperienced health providers 
                              as simply a manifestation of a personality disorder, 
                              when in fact it is a manifestation of impaired coping 
                              and the expression of futility at being unable to 
                              deal with life effectively. There is the constant 
                              experience of reduced cognitive stamina even though 
                              many frank cognitive symptoms have resolved. This 
                              usually takes the form of inability to keep up with 
                              the demands of life and inability to enjoy the process 
                              of living. There is often an anhedonic experience 
                              of going through the motions of living but without 
                              the ability to fully enjoy life events. These patients 
                              will often feel like they are on the outside looking 
                              in and not really participating. They feel detached 
                              and surrealistic about living. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Patients with a primary concussive 
                              injury and patients with predominant posttraumatic 
                              reaction can experience these changes in their sense 
                              of self. As a starting point for adequately assessing 
                              these issues it is usually helpful to have a psychological 
                              consultation incorporating some standardized, objective 
                              measures such as the MMPI-2 and the MCMI-III (Millon 
                              Clinical Multiaxial Inventory). This is useful in 
                              differentiating predominantly posttraumatic symptomatology 
                              from postconcussive complaints. The MMPI-2 is helpful 
                              in assessing primary features of psychological functioning 
                              and can be supplemented with the MCMI-III to gain 
                              a more in depth analysis of personality traits and 
                              style. This can guide the clinician in how to approach 
                              treatment. Patients with more extreme elevations 
                              on the MMPI-2 are typically experiencing greater 
                              distress and there may be a need for psychopharmacologic 
                              intervention. Examining personality style from the 
                              MCMI-III can give the clinician valuable information 
                              on how the expression of symptomatology will be 
                              seen by others and the relative strengths and weaknesses 
                              in personality structure. </P>

                              across the ninety items and following this is the 
                              Derogatis interpretation of scores. For patients 
                              below age range 19 years, cautious interpretations 
                              should be made with the awareness that the test 
                              is technically invalid or of limited validity. Again, 
                              the interpretations are based on statistically quantified 
                              results and every individual is different enough 
                              to allow only relative norms. Some of the questions 
                              of the SCL-90 are difficult to answer which further 
                              complicates individual interpretation. In our experience, 
                              many patients are interpreted as having obsessive- 
                              compulsive symptoms on this test probably far more 
                              than are warranted. Additionally, diagnostic hypotheses 
                              generated by the SCL-90 are only relevant in the 
                              appropriate clinical context. </P>

                              head trauma. When used in combination with the MMPI-2, 
                              a more comprehensive basis for understanding personality 
                              issues can be laid, with hypotheses being made for

                              are assessed inaccurately. Interpretation of these

                              also useful in understanding issues of symptom magnification

                              issues are usually inherent in medicolegal cases. 
                              Both the MMPI-2 and MCMI-III can be helpful in detecting 
                              a mind set towards over-reporting or under-reporting 
                              symptomatology. Verifying these issues are difficult 
                              and a conservative approach should be taken. Clinicians 
                              should look to the overall case presentation when 
                              making clinical judgment regarding the intentions

                            <P align="left"> Under-reporting of symptoms can often 
                              be related to the denial that is seen in patients 
                              with head trauma. These patients are acutely aware 
                              of problems in cognitive and psychological functioning, 
                              but often minimize these problems, hoping they will 
                              just go away. During a cursory initial clinical 
                              interview, the clinician can be misled into concluding 
                              that the patient is not in any significant distress, 
                              when in actuality they are often presenting themselves 
                              in a favorable light because it is too difficult 
                              for them to admit to the type of symptoms they are 
                              experiencing. Patients are often embarrassed to 
                              admit to having problems in their cognitive functioning. 
                              There is also a tendency to minimize problems with 
                              irritability, emotional volatility and reduced tolerance, 
                              as these problems may not be consistent with how 
                              they would like things to be. When there is consistency 
                              between psychological testing and clinical impression, 
                              this issue can be the catalyst to initiate a realistic 
                              acceptance of these problem areas so that recovery 
                              can be further facilitated. </P>
                            <P align="left"> On the other hand, over-reporting 
                              of symptomatology is a much debated issue whenever 
                              there are potential sources of secondary gain such 
                              as the case is in litigation. After ruling out other 
                              possible explanations of extreme elevations in clinical 
                              profiles from the MMPI-2 and less often the MCMI-III, 
                              the clinician can often detect this mind set towards 
                              exaggeration and be in a better position to explain 
                              the basis of persisting symptoms. This issue is 
                              almost always a part of the postconcussive spectrum 
                              and should be thoroughly evaluated. More often than 
                              not, patients may be magnifying symptoms rather 
                              than outright malingering. In addition, many patients 
                              magnify symptoms because of their need to convince 
                              the clinician that they really are having a legitimate 
                              problem. Intentional magnification of symptomatology 
                              is far less common than typically thought of among 
                              health care professionals and the legal community. 
                              Again, it should be pointed out that clarifying 
                              these issues takes time and the most valid and reliable 
                              assessment of under-reporting or over-reporting, 
                              regardless of the results of psychological testing, 
                              is to see the patient over a number of sessions 
                              to document the consistency of their symptom presentation.

                                pains ) is then taken. Information in this regard 
                                is based on any basic medical textbook and is 
                                not further amplified here although, of course, 
                                any positive features should be followed through. 
                                Allergy history is also elicited as well as injuries 
                                including the CHIT that may be the current main

                                physicians assistants often obtain this history.

                                a detailed medical history and miss critical information.

                              may not admit to any hallucinations: this may or

                              <I>evaluation</I>. It is clearly important to inquire 
                              about hallucinatory experiences, but asking about 
                              hallucinatory experience may get the response, "No, 
                              I never hear voices," when the patient is floridly 
                              hallucinating. The patient may or may not tell you 
                              about the voices he is hearing. Alternatively, he 
                              may describe voices he does not hear to ensure conscious

                              attention should be paid to possible dissimulation

                              Screening evaluation of the head injured patient 
                              using available bedside screening instruments is 
                              limited at present. The most widely used test (Naugle, 
                              1989), the Mini Mental Status Examination (FMMSE) 
                              (Folstein, 1975), is quickly administered and requires 
                              little training, but has little predictive power 
                              for diagnosis or classification of coarse neurobehavioral 
                              syndromes, and is not designed to detect mild cortical 
                              deficits (Naugle, 1989 ). Half of the MMSE s 30 
                              questions emphasize orientation and calculation; 
                              focal pathology is not effectively screened. Only 
                              30% of multi-infarct dementia patients (Babikian, 
                              1990) and 68% of Alzheimer's dementia patients scored 
                              below the recommended cut-off of 24/30 on the MMSE, 
                              raising questions about the test's sensitivity (Galasko, 
                              1990). Even more seriously, 85% were false-positive 
                              for the diagnosis of dementia, raising questions 
                              about its use in a geriatric community setting (Gagnon, 
                              1990). The MMSE also correlates poorly with basic 
                              everyday living skills (Katz ADL Scale)(Ferrell, 
                              1990), education and intelligence level, right hemisphere 
                              dysfunction, and mild cognitive dysfunction (Ferrell,

                              put in several scores. A subtest interpretative

                            <P align="left"> STRAW is an acronym for a new technique 
                              of evaluating involuntary movements, particularly 
                              tardive dyskinesia. Neppe developed the STRAW in 
                              the early 1990s because of the non-availability 
                              of adequate measures which would reliably differentiate 
                              subtle differences in tardive dyskinesia, and which 
                              could be easily scored within a 10% range by several 
                              different raters. </P>
                            <P align="left"> The STRAW has two components, a timing 
                              component and a severity component. The STRAW timing 
                              system involves equal scores of 50 for activation 
                              and rest. The key to the STRAW is the timed component. 
                              The timing component is scored out of 100 based 
                              on a time period using the criterion of presence. 
                              Tremor and epileptic seizure are not included as 
                              involuntary movements. </P>

                              and standing - the score is a rest score. The five 
                              evaluations during activity are each out of 10 making 
                              up 50 for activity (the TRAW) loaded equally with 
                              the 50 for rest (the S of the STRAW). </P>
                            <P align="left"> Three body sections are measured 
                              for severity: the head, the axial skeleton, and 
                              the limbs. Each body section is rated between 0 
                              and 10 in severity . In practice, the most severe 
                              of these three rankings is the one that is most 
                              closely followed over a period of time for tardive

                            <P align="left"> The STRAW timing system is multiplied

                              of 1000. It is thereafter divided by 10 to score 
                              out of 100. This gives an index of both severity 
                              and duration of particular physical signs. Table

                            <P align="left"> It is interesting that prior to the 
                              development of the EEG (by the neuropsychiatrist, 
                              Dr. Hans Berger in the 1930's) all seizure disorders 
                              were classified with mental disorders (Neppe, Tucker, 
                              1988A, 1988B, 1992). EEG technology remains rather 
                              primitive and reflections of brain waves from the 
                              perspective of analysis of psychopathology somewhat 
                              limited. Nevertheless, the only definitive way of 
                              demonstrating that a symptom or physical sign such 
                              as, for example, an olfactory hallucination is definitely 
                              epileptic, is the demonstration of correlates of 
                              seizure phenomena on EEG, such as spike-wave paroxysms, 
                              while the person is having that experience. This 
                              is unusual unless the seizure phenomena are relatively 
                              uncontrolled. Even in the event of them having such 
                              an experience, the EEG correlate may not necessarily 
                              be of a spike kind but depending on location, it 
                              could be normal or show a marked slowing, with a 
                              nonspecific theta rhythm generally of limited help 
                              unless focal or a delta rhythm, which is frankly 
                              abnormal unless the patient is asleep (theta is 
                              4 to 7 cycles per second, delta is less than 4). 
                              It is occasionally extremely difficult to localize 
                              such features on scalp EEG even when firing is occurring 
                              because symptoms may occur from the mesial temporal 
                              or deep structures within the brain which do not 
                              easily manifest on surface EEGs (Tucker, Neppe, 
                              1984, 1988). </P>

                            <P align="left"> Special techniques have been used 
                              to overcome the problem. One commonly used technique 
                              was nasopharyngeal electrodes but the increased 
                              yield with nasopharyngeal electrodes is insubstantial. 
                              A second placement is sphenoidal electrodes which 
                              unfortunately, requires time, expertise and discomfort 
                              limiting availability. A recent new suggestion has 
                              been the placement of electrodes on the buccal skin 
                              surface in the area of the submandibular notch - 
                              possibly as effective in picking up foci as sphenoidal 
                              placements. Finally, cerebral cortical placements 
                              during neurosurgery procedures may show firing, 
                              for example, in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy 
                              and psychosis, in the region of the hippocampus. 
                              The direct placement of intracranial electrodes 
                              shows how commonly spike firing may be occurring 
                              in this area with no correlate of any kind on surface 
                              EEGs (Neppe, Tucker, 1988A, 1988B, 1992).</P>

                            <P align="left"> There are several methods that are 
                              used for evoking electroencephalographic abnormalities. 
                              Sleep records increase the potential delineation 
                              of focal abnormality such as a temporal lobe focus 
                              by approximately fourfold. The administration of 
                              chloral hydrate, 1 to 3 grams as premedication prior 
                              to the sleep record is useful as this induces little 
                              change of significance in the electroencephalogram 
                              and does not prevent the demonstration of focal 
                              abnormalities. Certain medications should be particularly 
                              avoided in this regard. The first is the benzodiazepine 
                              group which may have by virtue of their very strong 
                              anti-epileptic effects profound effects in normalizing 
                              the EEG. Such effects at a receptor level may last 
                              weeks even with the apparent short acting benzodiazepines 
                              so that the yield of demonstrating epilepsy after 
                              the patient has had benzodiazepines administered 
                              apparently decreases substantially, although adequate 
                              data in this regard is not easily available (Neppe, 
                              1984). Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are 
                              also important evokers of abnormality in EEGs. </P>

                              for example, a 25 foot cable connected to the EEG 
                              montage on the patient's head. Very often no seizure 
                              manifestations are picked up for prolonged periods 
                              of time because seizures only occur paroxysmally. 
                              Moreover, those patients evaluated in a specialized 
                              center with EEG telemetry are invariably so atypical 
                              that the hypothesized seizure originates deep within 
                              the brain. The apparatus costs over $100,000 and 
                              the costs involved in monitoring patients are thousands 
                              per day at times for two weeks. Instead, home ambulatory 
                              electroencephalograms are easily available (Neppe, 
                              Tucker, 1988A, 1988B, 1992), (Neppe, Tucker, 1988A,

                              is a valuable test when the patient's symptomatology 
                              needs to be monitored day and night in a natural 
                              environment of home using computerized filtering 
                              of artefact. The advantage of this technique is 
                              to establish if any scalp electrode can detect events 
                              such as atypical spells alerted to by pushbuttons 
                              reflecting deep brain electrical activity. It has 
                              limited availability at this point, however, but 
                              our pick up rate for atypical spells and seizures 
                              is high. </P>

                              allows breakdown of wave forms and allows correlation

                              changes in particular areas of the brain which can 
                              be easily delineated at a visual level. This should 
                              prove to be a useful psychophysiological correlate 
                              of psychopathology. Indeed, this may be the beginning 
                              of an important new era. However, at this point 
                              in time it is still experimental. </P>

                                bleeding has not occurred. Usually, this is clear 
                                based on neurologic deficits or deterioration 
                                of some kind. However, if neuroradiologic anatomic

                            <P align="left"> We have stated previously that the 
                              patient with head injury symptoms is likely to have 
                              difficulty expressing their thoughts and ideas. 
                              This may be due to expressive deficits, a reduction 
                              In self awareness, or secondary to memory problems. 
                              Many patients with postconcussive symptoms experience 
                              a reduction in spontaneous word production and are 
                              unable to communicate the full extent of the changes 
                              in cognitive and psychological functioning. Patients 
                              with expressive problems often come up short in 
                              trying to explain the daily problems they are encountering. 
                              There may be dysnomia, poverty of thought content, 
                              and loss of their train of thought. This can result 
                              in inadequate clinical information being given to 
                              the health care provider, who in turn may under 
                              diagnose due to the appearance of minimal symptom 
                              presentation. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Concurrently, there may be an inability 
                              to fully appreciate the extent of cognitive problems 
                              or psychological changes. This can be due to denial 
                              and/or loss of ability to be aware of self and to 
                              engage in insightful introspection or self analysis. 
                              This is often seen with the frontal dysexecutive 
                              syndrome. These patients do not fully appreciate 
                              the changes in cognitive and psychological functioning 
                              that significant others are keenly aware of. </P>
                            <P align="left"> On the other hand, many patients 
                              go through a phase of denial, where they minimize 
                              their postconcussive problems and may present themselves 
                              in the most favorable light. This is often the case 
                              where patients have been inappropriately reassured 
                              by medical personnel that they will be back to normal 
                              within a relatively short period of time, or that 
                              there is nothing to worry about, or that their symptoms 
                              will gradually diminish with time and there is very 
                              little that can be done to treat them. When they 
                              continue to experience difficulty in cognitive functioning, 
                              continue to have problems with pain, and are unable 
                              to cope effectively, they experience cognitive dissonance 
                              because of their belief that they should be improving. 
                              They may deny or try to hide or minimize their difficulties 
                              with the hope that it will just go away. There may 
                              be embarrassment with regards to their cognitive 
                              problems, irritability and emotional volatility. 
                              These problems may often be obscured by the patient 
                              telling others that they just dont feel well. </P>

                              often more accurate than information given by the 
                              patient. The clinician should be careful to ask 
                              about physical, cognitive and psychological functioning. 
                              The most important issue to establish is whether 
                              or not the significant other or acquaintance has 
                              observed changes in the patients behavior following 
                              the traumatic event. </P>
                            <P align="left"> A review of the patients physical 
                              functioning from someone who is around the patient 
                              on a daily basis can provide valuable information 
                              regarding the frequency, intensity, and duration 
                              of complaints. It is important to ask about changes 
                              in the patients sense of smell and taste, since 
                              there is often a loss or partial loss of olfactory 
                              processes. This is often an overlooked symptom in 
                              the mild to moderate head injury population. Information 
                              should be gathered as to any complaints the patient 
                              may be making regarding more subtle changes in functioning 
                              such as sensitivity to bright light (sunlight or 
                              night driving), the sensation of obscurity to their 
                              visual acuity, ringing in the ears, intolerance 
                              to noise or distractions during active concentration, 
                              problems with coordination and tactile dexterity, 
                              poor proprioception, and sensation. Review of the 
                              patients pain behavior is essential in understanding 
                              the factors that may be influencing the experience 
                              of pain. </P>
                            <P align="left"> During a review of the patients cognitive 
                              functioning, the clinician should ask about situational 
                              manifestations of cognitive problems. The clinician 
                              needs to know how the patient is functioning across 
                              different situations and within a variety of environments. 
                              It is important to know if the patients cognitive 
                              changes are obvious to others and whether or not 
                              the patient is relying on others to compensate for 
                              his cognitive difficulties. </P>
                            <P align="left"> Primary care group members should 
                              be asked about the patients flow of thinking including 
                              speed of information processing, attention and concentration. 
                              The clinician should try to ascertain whether the 
                              patient is able to maintain and sustain attention 
                              and concentration and if there is distractibility. 
                              Memory processing should be thoroughly evaluated 
                              to establish a pattern of memory problems that is 
                              specific to that patient. It is not enough to just 
                              document the presence or absence of memory problems. 
                              It is also important to review the patients problem 
                              solving abilities, organizational skills, reasoning, 
                              the ability to perform sequential activities and 
                              make schedules and plan ahead. Mental arithmetic 
                              reasoning should be asked about regarding the patients 
                              ability to keep up with finances, make change, and 
                              estimate necessary everyday calculations. The clinician 
                              should ask about the patients ability to express 
                              themselves, word finding difficulties, losing their 
                              train of thought and the style of speech. The patients 
                              comprehension and receptive language abilities should 
                              also be reviewed including reading comprehension, 
                              the ability to follow TV programs, and how well 
                              the patient understands and responds to others.

                            <P align="left"> Perhaps the most important reason 
                              for obtaining collateral information is to document 
                              and describe the changes in psychological functioning. 
                              Head trauma patients typically are better historians 
                              with respect to their physical functioning, but 
                              have more difficulty describing changes in themselves. 
                              Individuals who know the patient well are often 
                              able to notice changes in mood and affect more readily 
                              than the patient. It is important to know how the 
                              patient is responding to stress. The clinician should 
                              determine whether the patient is more irritable, 
                              is less patient with others, has low frustration 
                              tolerance and whether there have been episodes of 
                              emotional volatility. Questions should also be asked 
                              about frontal lobe behavior, especially increased 
                              passivity or aggressivity. Routine questions should 
                              also be included to asses other areas of psychological 
                              functioning in consideration of secondary psychological 
                              problems such as anxiety or depression. </P>
