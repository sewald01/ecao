                          <h2> BACKGROUND TO ASSESSMENT OF THE CHIT</h2>
                          <div align="left">We have defined the "closed head injury 
                            syndrome of transient kind" (CHIT) as having several 
                            subtypes: a physiological brain injury of the post 
                            concussional dimension (PCCHITs), a psychological 
                            dysfunction of post-traumatic kind (PTCHITs), a focal 
                            residual kind (FRCHITs) or combinations mixed with 
                            these (MCHITs). Further, there is a synergistic physical, 
                            cognitive and psychological synergism across the post 
                            traumatic functional syndrome and legitimate brain 
                            injury and predisposing factors and degrees of physiological 
                            brain reserve may determine exact manifestations of 
                            a CHIT. (Neppe and Goodwin, In Press) </div>
                          <p align="left">We have seen how "minor" CHI is often 
                            not minor. The misnomer of mild often is linked with 
                            significant and brief, or no impairments of consciousness 
                            may be associated with significant residua of the 
                            CHIT. Some patients may manifest pathoplastic compensations 
                            less with pre-existing conditions such that the symptoms 
                            of the CHIT may relate to the straw that broke the 
                            camel's back. Additionally, the actual pathogenetic 
                            changes in CHITs may manifest in both focal and generalized 
                            forms. (Neppe and Goodwin, In Press) 
                          <p align="left">We have demonstrated how time based 
                            evaluations of comprehensive kind may be the most 
                            valuable way of monitoring of the headache, dizziness, 
                            concentration, myalgic pains, memory disturbance and 
                            sleep disturbance and specific complications including 
                            seizure disorders, atypical spells and fibromyalgia 
                            that may follow CHITs. The neuropsychiatric evaluation 
                            is not a single interview over forty minutes or an 
                            hour. It cannot be done in one interview: it is too 
                            complex and, moreover, the time based evaluation allows 
                            a film strip view in which the whole system, all the 
                            biopsychofamiliosociocultural elements, must be taken 
                            into account. (Neppe and Goodwin, In Press) 
                          <p align="left">The sequence of such a basic exam involves 
                            outside sources of history and information, demographics 
                            analysis, a detailed main complaint with injury information, 
                            relevant past psychiatric and neurologic history including 
                            any other injuries and any links with lawsuits, a 
                            detailed pharmacologic history including doses, duration, 
                            combinations, responsiveness, side-effects, a history 
                            of abuse of recreational drugs, basic habits, a detailed 
                            computerized history of social and medical facets, 
                            psychological and personality evaluations, obtaining 
                            of collateral information, and detailed neurologic, 
                            psychiatric, mental status, and neuropsychiatric cerebral 
                            cortical evaluations. Furthermore, specialized testing 
                            is then done. All this information is then elaborated 
                            and examined producing diagnoses using a multiaxial 
                            framework of both neurologic and psychiatric kind. 
                            Consequently, management of the patient with a CHIT 
                            requires comprehensive time based evaluations and 
                            significant planning. Such handling is both pharmacological

                            with modern pharmacology that we began to understand

                            management in the CHIT patient with the awareness 
                            that management involves two components : further 
                            investigations as necessary and pharmacologic and

                          <h2> INTRODUCTION</h2>
                          <div align="left">Four levels of management exist in 
                            the CHIT patient, namely further investigations, cognitive 
                            rehabilitation, non-pharmacologic approaches and pharmacologic 
                            interventions. This chapter focuses on the last - 
                            the pharmacologic - but all four areas are critical. 
                          </div>
                          <h3> FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
                          <div align="left">After the longitudinal time-based 
                            initial evaluation, additional tests are based on 
                            the specific evaluation. Early on such tests as MRI, 
                            CT and routine sleep and wake electroencephalography 
                            plus supporting blood tests should be performed as 
                            indicated in the previous section (Neppe and Goodwin, 
                            in press). Changes in behavior should be carefully 
                            monitored as accurate diagnosis and evaluation is 
                            a key to appropriate management and further tests 
                            done as indicated. </div>
                          <h3> COGNITIVE REHABILITATION OF THE CHIT PATIENT</h3>
                          <div align="left">Cognitive rehabilitation is exceedingly 
                            important. The potential use of computers in this 
                            regard is an area in its infancy that will rapidly 
                            grow over the next decade. This is also not specifically 
                            focussed on in this chapter. <br>

                          <h4> NON-PHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES: Basic guidelines 
                            and habits</h4>
                          The following guidelines have been prepared for the 
                          CHIT patient. 
                          <p align="left">1. DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
                            Three regular meals per day are essential Vegetables 
                            and fruit are particularly useful. Avoid highly refined 
                            sugars such as candies Consideration of supplementation 
                            with Vitamins such as E, D, B6 and C or a complex 
                            of multivitamins is warranted. Even Vitamins can be 
                            toxic in high doses so appropriate dosing is important. 
                            Additionally, drug interactions can occur given the 
                            fat solubility of such vitamins as A, E and D. Avoid 
                            saccharins and nutrasweet until it is established 
                            that no specific behavioral effects occur correlating 
                            with these. Significant water intake is useful (hence 
                            the value of water filters) Plenty of exercise regulated 
                            appropriately by the primary care physician is valuable 
                            - graded aerobic elements 
                          <p align="left">2. HABITUAL CONSUMPTION CHANGE: <br>
                            a. Cut down on any CAFFEINATED beverage consumption. 
                            Because of the presence of symptomatology which may 
                            in part be attributed to the caffeine intake, we recommend 
                            the patient to taper totally off beverages - coffee 
                            tea cola drinks - at the rate of 1 cup per day. Decaffeinated 
                            beverages can be taken as needed instead. Withdrawal 
                            effects such as caffeine withdrawal headache can be 
                            managed with acetaminophen and a slower taper of the 
                            caffeine. 
                          <p align="left">b. Cut down on any ALCOHOL. Besides 
                            direct effects, this will commonly interact with medications 
                            at one or more of four levels: absorption, altered 
                            metabolism, modified responsiveness at receptor levels 
                            and behavioral effects. Unless there are specific 
                            reasons, such as seizures triggered by a tot of wine, 
                            previous or current alcohol or drug difficulties or 
                            such predisposition, aggression or bizarre previous 
                            reactions to alcohol or driving, the occasional small 
                            amount of low potency alcohol (e.g. beer) or medium 
                            potency (e.g. wine) is acceptable. 
                          <p align="left">c. Clearly the use of any PLEASURE DRUGS 
                            of abuse should be avoided. 
                          <p align="left">d. Cut down on SMOKING. This can also 
                            be done using a slow taper. The availability of either 
                            Nicorette gum or Habitrol is a useful usable adjunct 
                            in this regard. Smoking withdrawal is commonly associated 
                            with weight gain and I have recommended that noncalorific 
                            fluids such as water be used instead; appropriate 
                            solids would be lentils, carrots and tomatoes which 
                            can be eaten instead. Moreover, changes in cigarette 
                            habit may result in different prescription needs because 
                            drug interactions or hepatic metabolism may change. 
                          <p align="left">3. PROPER HYGIENE: <br>
                            a. ALLERGY: An air filter in home may be useful particularly 
                            in the context of any allergy history. 
                          <p align="left">b. BED AND SLEEP: The mattress should 
                            be good and firm; it should be turned regularly; The 
                            pillow should be comfortable; a neck pillow should 
                            be used in the event of neck pain. Any snoring should 
                            be taken seriously and this associated with any other 
                            features of possible sleep apnea, such as day time 
                            fatigue or periods of not breathing noted by others 
                            handled. The value of adequate temperature in the 
                            room - neither hot nor cold cannot be over-estimated. 
                            During winter, if greater fatigue or seasonal variations 
                            of mood arise, the use of a simple timer switch to 
                            create artificial light may be valuable; failing this 
                            more appropriate light therapy may be used, if necessary 
                            and severe enough. 
                          <p align="left">c. NECK A nodule vibrator or equivalent 
                            for the neck in the event of any neck pain may be 
                            useful. 
                          <p align="left">4. SPECIAL ISSUES: <br>
                            a. MEMORY: Most so-called memory deficits have a significant 
                            functional component frequently relating to the non-specific 
                            symptoms of poor concentration. Valuable is the habit 
                            of recording information in a note-book to be carried 
                            around everywhere. This should include a list of To 
                            Do items and an address book. A cheap watch with multiple 
                            alarms is useful to ensure compliance with medications 
                            and relevant arrangements 
                          <p align="left">b. SPEECH: The use of computerized software 
                            (such as the program Word Foundry by Nordic software) 
                            may be useful for receptive or executive level mild 
                            aphasia. If the initial evaluation is suggestive of 
                            speech pathology, subtle elements could have been 
                            missed such as specific reading disability and an 
                            educational evaluation should be performed. 
                          <p align="left">c. PSYCHOLOGICAL: Express anger by using 
                            a punch bag. Exercise may be useful Loneliness may 
                            be alleviated by joining a social club. Write notes 
                            to self to express distress 
                          <p align="left">d. DRIVING: The operation of any motor 
                            or any other vehicle is always controversial. Most 
                            medications sedate somewhat and even those that do 
                            not may cause paradoxic reactions. On the other hand, 
                            certain conditions such as anxiety, day-time sleepiness, 
                            seizures, poor concentration or memory disturbance 
                            aggravate driving risk and the treatment may be assisting 
                            these problems. Extreme care should be used when driving, 
                            and even when it is deemed safe to drive short distances 
                            in familiar areas, it may be unsafe on longer or unfamiliar 
                            drives. Driving should be avoided in the event of 
                            doubt as to safety to drive not only on behalf of 
                            the patient but the family. Driving a car is always 
                            the ultimate responsibility of the individual driving 
                            it. The physician can advise in cases of uncertainty 
                            - frequently, medication control is safer than the 
                            untreated underlying condition, but any sedation or 
                            slowed reaction times or impaired consciousness or 
                            sleep, visual or memory impairment is a good reason 
                            not to drive. 
                          <p align="left">e. PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC SUPPORT Supportive 
                            psychotherapy with an appropriately trained therapist 
                            is useful. This should be directed at support with 
                            regard to current problems as well as allowing the 
                            patient a smoother transition as readjustments back 
                            to a healthy core occurs. Depth therapeutic probing, 
                            uncovering many layers of the patients psyche should 
                            be approached only with extreme caution as this may 
                            lead to further decompensation. 
                          <p align="left">f. BEHAVIORAL ELEMENTS: Access to a 
                            firearm, in the context of significant psychopathology 
                            linked with the CHIT, is dangerous. This should be 
                            avoided if at all possible. 
                          <p align="left">g. FOLLOW UP The patient should always 
                            have a regular follow-up primary care physician to 
                            handle any acute problems. <br>

                          <div align="left">Pharmacologic interventions are dependent 
                            on diagnostic evaluation. The four major intervention 
                            groups are: 
                            <ol>
                              <li> The azapirone, buspirone, technically an anxioselective 
                                agent, is the most versatile and possibly the 
                                safest of all medications in the CHIT. However, 
                                because of the organicity, even buspirone is sometimes 
                                associated with paradoxic reactions, such as irritability 
                                instead of anti-aggressive effects.</li>
                              <li> The use of anticonvulsant medication for focal 
                                residual CHITs is critical at times.</li>
                              <li> Assistance with disruption of the biological 
                                cycle of sleep.</li>
                              <li> Antidepressant medication is commonly used 
                                to manage the depression and also the pain syndromes.</li>
                            </ol>
                            More uncommon interventions are linked with: 
                            <ol>
                              <li> Beta-adrenergic blocking agents like nadolol 
                                and propranolol which are sometimes useful in 
                                situations of autonomic instability with significant 
                                somatization.</li>
                              <li> Occasional psychostimulant medication is used 
                                for the apathy or for an attention deficit disorder 
                                like condition or for profound sleepiness.</li>
                              <li> Use of antipsychotic medication such as perphenazine.</li>
                              <li> Supplements such as minerals , vitamins and 
                                the various fatty acids are all speculative approaches 
                                generally characterized by the absence of specific

                            Prior to medicating with extras, one approach is often 
                            to establish that a drug is indeed doing more good 
                            than harm. Tapering or cessation of any medication 
                            prescribed in a CHIT is a reasonable approach when 
                            side-effects are significant or there is a lack of 
                            therapeutic effects

                            Whenever prescribed, the patient should ensure that 
                            the pharmacist dispensing the prescription give a 
                            package insert which can be read to ensure familiarity 
                            with side-effects. However, this should be in the 
                            context of appropriate medical education by the prescribing 
                            physician and the pharmacist lest the patient distort 
                            side-effects and therapeutic indication which in the 
                            CHIT context is frequently outside labeling. It is 
                            good practice for physicians to develop specific schedules 
                            in this regard prioritizing relevant side-effects 
                            and dosing difficulties. Frequently, side-effects 
                            pertaining to weight gain on such medications as valproate, 
                            tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics are not 
                            listed in such inserts. Some effects listed are very 
                            uncommon or may not necessarily be associated with 
                            the medication specifically but may have been coincidental. 
                            The patient should feel free to further discuss these 
                            with the physician.

                              Treatment is commonly based on symptom alleviation

                              Following transient traumatic head injury, a range 
                              of central nervous system dysfunctions may ultimately 
                              influence the behavior we site as characterological 
                              disturbances. Organic links (from diverse etiologies) 
                              have been noted particularly in antisocial personality 
                              by Lewis and Bella (1976), Robins (1966), Thomas 
                              and Chess (1977l, and Tucker and Pincus (1980). 
                              Usually these correlate with antisocial behavior 
                              and delinquency that relates to EEG abnormalities, 
                              delayed reaction times, and seizure disorders. (Tucker, 
                              Neppe 1988) The heterogeneous and poorly validated 
                              condition of borderline personality disorder with 
                              fluctuations in affect, intensity of experience,

                            <p align="left">Anxiety is a ubiquitous psychiatric 
                              symptom. Episodes of anxiety, particularly so-called 
                              "panic attacks" may correlate in our experience 
                              with complex partial seizures. Such events were 
                              recognized by Hughlings Jackson last century. (Neppe, 
                              1984A) Most anxieties with head injuries are likely 
                              to be on the psychological side not due to brain 
                              injury however. 
                            <p align="left">BUSPIRONE (BUSPAR) medication. This 
                              is a prime drug for the patient with a CHIT because 
                              of its versatility and safety. The buspirone can 
                              be used for the approved usage of relieving anxiety 
                              / mixed anxiety depression in the post-traumatic 
                              CHIT. In this instance, the post-synaptic serotonin 
                              1A partial agonist effect comes into play. The usual 
                              dose for anxiety is 10 mg t.i.d., for mixed-anxiety 
                              depression is 15 mg t.i.d. (Neppe, 1990 A, 1989A, 
                              1993A) However, it should alleviate the following 
                              symptoms&nbsp; 
                              <!-- which are not FDA approved -->
                              sometimes linked with anxiety which are frequently 
                              relate to post-concussional phenomena of the CHIT: 
                              concentration disturbance and also the spectrum 
                              of agitation, irritability, frustration, anger, 
                              aggression (where no FDA approved drugs exist): 
                              Two dose levels of dosage are useful - low e.g. 
                              5 mg t.i.d. which probably reflects autoreceptor 
                              raphe serotonergic nuclei effects; and high for 
                              considerable agitation and co-existing other symptoms 
                              e.g. 20 mg t.i.d. probably reflecting a predominantly 
                              serotonin 1A weak agonist effect. The low dose is 
                              based on the uncontrolled work of Neppe on non-organic 
                              patients and Ratey on mental retardates, the higher 
                              dose on Neppe's research. In many patients, we suggest 
                              initiating dosage at 5 mg t.i.d. built up gradually 
                              by increasing by 5 mg every 3 days to a initial 
                              aim level of 60 mg per day: if the patient develops 
                              non-vertiginous dizziness then drop the dose by 
                              5 mg per day and continue the taper of dose until 
                              no dizziness occurs. Additionally, many CHIT patients 
                              reveal a predisposition towards obsessionality . 
                              Doses of e.g. 20mg t.i.d. probably reflect a predominantly 
                              serotonin 1A weak agonist effect and could be useful

                              disorder - Clomipramine (Anafranil) and SSRI drugs 
                              like fluoxetine (Prozac) often have significant 
                              side-effects in this population. Important relevant 
                              side-effects are:

                                  physician and continue the dose at this lower

                              recurrently. An epileptic seizure involves paroxysmal 
                              cerebral neuronal firing which may or may not produce 
                              disturbed consciousness and / or other perceptual 
                              or motor alterations (Neppe, 1988A, B). The most 
                              classical and common epileptic seizures are of the 
                              "grand mal" or generalized "tonic - clonic" kind. 
                              These usually involve relatively short (10-30 seconds)

                              with a phase of laryngeal stridor due to tonic muscles 
                              manifesting as a high pitched scream sound. Urinary 
                              and occasionally fecal incontinence may occur due 
                              to sphincteric change and the seizures are almost 
                              invariably followed by headache, sleepiness and 
                              / or confusion. When preceded by perceptual, autonomic, 
                              affective or cognitive alterations such seizures 
                              are secondarily generalized, as opposed to no original 
                              locus of firing producing focal features prior to 
                              the tonic clonic movements (generalized from the 
                              start) (Neppe, 1982 A ). The different epileptic 
                              seizures are classified in Table 1.

                              all variants are measured it would be difficult 
                              to estimate exact incidence. This is particularly 
                              so in the context of transient closed head injury. 
                              (CHIT) There is a dichotomy of the possibly 90% 
                              of epileptics who constitute the epilepsy standard 
                              patient who have no more psychopathology than the 
                              average patient and the epilepsy plus patient - 
                              a minority of epilepsy patients having behavioral 
                              or psychiatric abnormalities (Neppe, Tucker 1992). 
                              Seizure disorders present with a high incidence 
                              of behavioral disturbance, which may initially be 
                              interpreted as psychiatric in origin (Neppe, Tucker, 
                              1989, 1994). Many of these relate to the temporal 
                              lobe of the brain. The features of temporal lobe 
                              epilepsy are so varied and so protean that it is 
                              necessary to classify them. Neppe has suggested 
                              the term "possible temporal lobe symptoms" (PTLSs) 
                              for this (Neppe, 1983 A). These are features which 
                              can be induced by stimulating areas of the temporal 
                              lobe during neurosurgery. These symptoms only become 
                              specific symptoms of temporal lobe dysfunction if 
                              their occurrence is validated empirically during 
                              a seizure - either through observation or by the 
                              electroencephalogram (hence the word "possible" 
                              in possible temporal lobe seizures) ( Table 2 ) 
                              (Neppe, 1983 B). Using a phenomenological analysis, 
                              Neppe was able to demonstrate that the symptom of 
                              deja vu commonly regarded as symptomatic of temporal 
                              lobe epilepsy indeed had a very special phenomenologic 
                              quality in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy 
                              (Neppe, 1983 A, 1983C ). This involves its association 
                              with post-ictal features such as sleepiness, headache 
                              and clouded consciousness and its link in time with 
                              these features. This association provides an excellent 
                              clue to the existence of temporal lobe epilepsy. 
                              Deja vu is a normal phenomenon occurring in 70 percent 
                              of the population and unless such phenomenological 
                              detail is obtained, patients' symptomatology may 
                              be misinterpreted. Neppe has similarly done such 
                              a study with olfactory hallucinations (Neppe, 1983 
                              B, D, 1982 B). A specific type of temporal lobe 
                              epilepsy olfactory hallucination could not be demonstrated 
                              although there were suggestive features (Neppe, 
                              1984B). A major message, therefore, may be the relevance 
                              of adequately assessing the symptomatology of patients 
                              presenting with epilepsy. It may be that this is 
                              a direction as relevant as electroencephalographic 
                              monitoring (Neppe, 1993 B). <br>

                              Kindling may be relevant in head injury. Generally 
                              several events would be required to trigger such 
                              a phenomenon but CHIT theoretically may the straw 
                              that broke the camel's back. We discuss kindling 
                              briefly below. 
                            <p align="left">Kindling involves the progression 
                              of increasingly severe seizure manifestations in 
                              response to electrical stimuli of various areas 
                              of the brain such as the hippocampus, amygdala, 
                              pyriform cortex, or basal ganglia. Such stimulation 
                              is initially sub-threshold, but becomes threshold 
                              when administered repetitively. These sub-threshold 
                              changes, which have been demonstrated in numerous 
                              animal species, at times manifest with behavioral 
                              changes sometimes preceding the motor seizures (Neppe, 
                              1985A,B,C). Neppe recognized that there are distinct 
                              biochemical and other differences between so-called 
                              electrical kindling and the chemical induction of 
                              the process and so developed the term chindling 
                              for the chemical induction of increasingly severe 
                              seizure manifestations in response to general chemical 
                              stimuli (Neppe, 1989 B). 
                            <p align="left">Kindling is increasingly difficult 
                              to induce with the added degrees of encephalization 
                              in primates. If, indeed, the kindling phenomenon 
                              occurs in man, it would probably take many years. 
                              There is indirect evidence for its occurrence in 
                              the development of mirror foci, generalization of 
                              seizures, the alcohol withdrawal paradigm, and possibly 
                              paradigms of response pertaining to nonresponsive 
                              psychosis (Tucker, Neppe, 1988, 1991). However, 
                              kindling has become a very useful theoretical concept 
                              to rationalize interventions pertaining to adjunctive 
                              drugs, particularly anticonvulsants. Whether or 
                              not kindling is shown to be an artifact or not is 
                              probably not of vital importance, for its role may 
                              be as a stimulant to further research. <br>

                              The preferential anticonvulsants in this instance 
                              are not necessarily for a seizure indication, per 
                              se. The subpopulation of CHIT being treated is the 
                              focal residual group. They may manifest with frank 
                              post-traumatic seizures, however, they may have 
                              atypical spells manifesting as the various kinds 
                              of episodic events that we have called paroxysmal 
                              neurobehavioral disorder (PND). Diagnosis is based 
                              clinically, on EEG and on anticonvulsant responsiveness. 
                            <p align="left">The management of epileptics presenting 
                              with behavior disturbance is closely linked to the 
                              discussion of epilepsy in relation to psychopathology. 
                              The heterogeneity of such conditions implies a heterogeneity 
                              of management which is patient based and individually 
                              tailored (Neppe, 1988). 
                            <p align="left">The most important single principle 
                              is anticonvulsant monotherapy. It has been well 
                              demonstrated that the degree of seizure control 
                              is not increased by increasing the number of anticonvulsant 
                              medications. (Neppe, Tucker 1988 A, B) It is more 
                              important to achieve adequate anticonvulsant dosage 
                              and therapeutic ranges on blood levels are often 
                              helpful indicators. However, the object should be 
                              to adequately control all the patient's seizures 
                              and the choice of anticonvulsant is equally important. 
                              Management of patients with seizure disorders involves 
                              primarily appropriate use of anticonvulsants (Neppe, 
                              Tucker, 1988B). In addition, counseling and the 
                              various aspects of psychosocial support, allowing 
                              the patient to live as normal a life as possible, 
                              and to be supported within the framework of the 
                              environment, is also important. 
                            <p align="left">a. CARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol) is the 
                              primary drug in this group for the CHIT indication 
                              as it seems to have a specific psychotropic effect. 
                              We use it predominantly in the context of temporal 
                              lobe phenomena. It should not to be generically 
                              substituted (Neppe et al, 1988C ). The carbamazepine 
                              in this instance can be used for the approved usage 
                              of relieving seizure disorders or any incidental 
                              neuralgia and sometimes fibromyalgia (unapproved 
                              and unproven). In seizures, the anticonvulsant effect 
                              comes into play. The usual dose for seizures are 
                              200-400 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. based on monitoring 
                              serum levels to 8-12 ug/ 100 ml and clinical responsiveness 
                              and we have found usually slightly lower doses to 
                              be adequate in atypical spells, PND and temporal 
                              lobe dysfunction e.g. 200 mg tid. 
                            <p align="left">Carbamazepine should alleviate the

                              no FDA approved drugs exist): agitation, irritability, 
                              frustration, anger, aggression, mood lability, temporal 
                              lobe symptomatology: The dose levels are probably 
                              in the low therapeutic anticonvulsant range e.g. 
                              6-9 ug/ 100 ml and frequently correspond with an 
                              initial target dose of 200 mg t.i.d. The low dose 
                              is based on the double blind controlled work of 
                              Neppe on patients with EEG temporal lobe abnormalities 
                              and refractory psychosis with hostility and a follow-up

                              The mechanism may be via kindling or chindling and 
                              episodic phenomena respond best (Neppe, 1990 B).

                              Prior to beginning the carbamazepine treatment, 
                              the following baseline blood tests should be performed: 
                              Complete blood count including differential cell 
                              count with optional platelet and reticulocyte count. 
                              Hepatic enzymes including Gamma Glutamyl Transferase. 
                              Electrolytes. At subsequent visits, the carbamazepine 
                              levels can be measured and after establishing a 
                              new baseline the CBC and GGT can be monitored as 
                              necessary. Folate, a B vitamin, supplementation 
                              is often necessary based on possible subclinical 
                              deficiency induced by carbamazepine which induces 
                              hepatic enzymes - folate is a co-enzyme in this 
                              cycle. Doses of 5 mg daily are recommended. Calcium 
                              supplementation e.g. as gluconate is also relevant 
                              sometimes. One mechanism may be carbamazepine enzyme 
                              induction producing subclinical Vitamin D deficiency 
                              particularly in a cloudy climate. </div>

                              therapeutic levels e.g. 20 ug/ ml are associated 
                              with significantly more cognitive side-effects than

                              are examples. Consequently, lower doses may be more 
                              logical even with adjunctive second anticonvulsant,

                              DIVALPROEX SODIUM (also called Valproate) (DEPAKOTE 
                              - not a generic) may be useful particularly with 
                              residual focal frontal lobe phenomena. The Valproate 
                              has an approved usage of relieving seizure disorders 
                              and for prophylaxis of bipolar illness and for headache 
                              prophylaxis. However, it could alleviate the following 
                              symptoms which are not FDA approved: agitation, 
                              irritability, frustration, anger, aggression, mood 
                              lability, temporal lobe symptomatology (no FDA approved 
                              drugs exist) but there is limited clinical use in 
                              these areas because frequently there is limited 
                              effectiveness. A starting dose of 250 mg t.i.d. 
                              is suggested. The usual dose for seizures are 250-1000 
                              mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. based on clinical responsiveness 
                              mainly but also -far less reliable with valproate 
                              - monitoring of serum levels to 70-100 ug/ 100 ml. 
                              For non-approved uses slightly lower doses e.g. 
                              250 mg-500 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. with similar blood 
                              levels to seizures may be appropriate. Whether the 
                              mechanism then is anticonvulsant or psychotropic 
                              is unknown. </div>
                            <p align="left">A major advantage of valproate is 
                              it is generally well tolerated with few side-effects 
                              and less sedative than carbamazepine. Important 
                              side-effects relevant for the patient include:

                              following baseline blood tests should be performed:

                              b. 3. GABAPENTIN (NEURONTIN) This new anticonvulsant 
                              has the advantage of low toxicity, low range of 
                              side-effects and no known drug interactions. Serum 
                              levels are not helpful for clinical practice as 
                              they are non-correlative with therapeutic range 
                              or toxicity and they are, in general, unavailable. 
                              Technically gabapentin is an adjunctive anticonvulsant, 
                              but it may be tried in monotherapy for specific 
                              symptoms. Doses of 100 mg t.i.d. are low average 
                              although 20% get sedated so start low 100 mg daily 
                              building by 100 mg QOD till better control e.g. 
                              300 mg t.i.d. </div>
                            <p align="left">b.4. LAMOTRIGINE (LAMICTAL) This new

                              in numerous countries before that. It has remarkable 
                              effects on some although in our experience patients 
                              may initially become paradoxically worse with each 
                              increase in dose. Like gabapentin, serum levels 
                              are unnecessary and unavailable. Technically, it 
                              too is an adjunctive anticonvulsant, but it may 
                              be tried in monotherapy for specific symptoms. Doses 
                              of 25 mg daily built up to 100-200 mg bid over several 
                              weeks are average.

                              United States Tiagabine marketed October 1997). 
                              Topiramate comes in 25 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg sizes. 
                              Begin with 25 mg bid and build if necessary to up 
                              to 400 mg daily. Tiagabine has small milligram sizes 
                              with the starting dosage of about 4 mg daily and 
                              the usual dosage of 12 through 40 mg per day. Both 
                              drugs are useful as adjunctive therapy in patients 
                              whose seizures are uncontrolled on monotherapy particularly 
                              in partial seizures. Side-effects for both are rather 
                              typical for anticonvulsants namely fatigue and psychomotor

                            <p align="left">3. THE BIOLOGICAL SLEEP CYCLE DISRUPTION: 
                              Sleep disorders <br>
                              One of the most common complaints after CHIT is 
                              sleep disturbance which may take months or years 
                              to fully improve. Many such complaints may be psychiatrically 
                              linked, however, some may have biological bases, 
                              linked with the conditions above. Sleep disorders 
                              are among the most fundamental of all psychiatric 
                              disorders, and certain psychiatric illnesses may 
                              well have a very profound base with regard to sleep 
                              disturbance. For example, a diagnosis of mania may 
                              be nearly impossible without a profound decrease 
                              in total sleep time and, in fact, most manics have 
                              a period of at least 36 hours where they do not 
                              sleep at all and during which they do not feel fatigued 
                              (Tucker, Neppe, 1988) Similarly, a shift with phase 
                              advance and a decreased latency to rapid eye movement 
                              sleep is characteristic of a biological depression. 
                              Another common symptom in this condition is terminal 
                              insomnia - early morning waking. This may or may 
                              not be correlated with this phase advancement as 
                              the two have not been investigated (Tucker, Neppe, 
                              1988). 
                            <p align="left">Sleep disturbance is of profound importance 
                              in the CHIT but may reflect underlying affective 
                              disorder or personality. Many patients with profound 
                              degrees of antisocial personality give a history 
                              of sleep disturbance involving paroxysmal wakenings 
                              since childhood. Many brain impaired individuals

                              The area of mood disorders allows possible practical 
                              and theoretical understanding of the role of the 
                              central nervous system in behavior disorders. Affective 
                              disturbances may be triggered or induced by head 
                              injury with or without patients with traumatic temporal 
                              lobe epilepsy (Neppe, Tucker 1994) and head trauma 
                              (Neppe, Tucker 1994; Tucker, Neppe 1991). 
                            <p align="left">We believe that CHIT may trigger "Depressive 
                              pseudodementia" in patients with limited cerebral 
                              reserve (MacAllister, 1983, 1992). This refers to 
                              the organic symptomatology, particularly dementing 
                              symptoms in affectively disturbed patients. Cognitive 
                              and neuropsychologic disturbances are associated 
                              with affective disturbances generally reversible 
                              with treatment. Consequently, in dealing with the 
                              demented patient, one must rule out affective disturbance 
                              in the older patient (Neppe, Tucker 1994). 
                            <p align="left">a. LITHIUM CARBONATE (ESKALITH AND 
                              OTHERS - choice is optional): occasionally lithium 
                              is useful when patients manifest cyclical phenomena 
                              of their residual focal CHIT. Medication problems 
                              with lithium are linked commonly to tremor which 
                              is a rather coarse static one which patients find 
                              impairing in functionality and embarrassing. Some 
                              patients become nauseous and/ or confused. Our preference 
                              is to lower dosage in the event of any of the above 
                              symptoms. Baseline blood tests of electrolytes and 
                              renal functions are important as is frequent monitoring 
                              for a major but neglected long-term complication 
                              nephrogenic diabetes insipidus commonly presenting 
                              as polyuria or nocturia. One way to initiate lithium 
                              is by giving 600 mg on the first day and check a 
                              level after 24 hours. This will also screen for 
                              those who become Lithium toxic rather quickly. Lithium 
                              is an extremely lethal compound and should be used 
                              under supervision of a psychiatrist. Two different 
                              blood levels can be considered: Low dose with less 
                              side-effect potential but possibly less control: 
                              aim at a blood level of 0.4-0.6 meq / L. High dose 
                              with more side-effect potential but possibly more 
                              control: aim at a blood level of 0.7-0.9 meq / L. 
                              Many colleagues use higher doses but this would 
                              not be my preference in this instance. 
                            <p align="left">b. ANTIDEPRESSANT options can be applied 
                              in the context of mobilization of significant or 
                              major depression either post-traumatically or post-concussionally 
                              in the CHIT or in alleviation of pain (not approved). 
                              Our preference is to avoid the SSRIs group as well 
                              as the tricyclics and to use nefazodone or venlafaxine 
                              as selective drugs acting reasonably physiologically 
                              at the norepinephrine and serotonin receptor levels. 
                              Bupropion may also be of value. 
                            <p align="left">b.1. NEFAZODONE (Serzone): This antidepressant 
                              of triazolopyridine structure has ideal theoretical 
                              elements both for agitated and retarded depression. 
                              The reason relates to its modulating SSRI properties 
                              which implies less side-effects such as agitation, 
                              anxiety, sexual related pathology, nausea, akathisia 
                              and suicidality. It has additionally serotonin 2 
                              blocking effects which should enhance both antidepressant 
                              and anti-aggressive properties and further diminish 
                              SSRI side-effects. It is more sedative than the 
                              other SSRIs but far less than the triazolopyridine, 
                              Trazodone. My preference is to start with doses 
                              of 50 mg bid and increase every 3 days by 50 mg 
                              daily, always giving bid dosing until an initial 
                              dose of 200 mg bid is achieved. Doses should best 
                              be given in the morning and afternoon because of 
                              its short half life and uneven kinetics. Costs of 
                              all sizes are equal - 200 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 
                              mg. Serzone inhibits the 3A4 part of Cytochrome 
                              P450 enzyme system in the liver. This increases 
                              levels of certain chemicals e.g. ketoconazole, alprazolam, 
                              triazolam, and probably SSRIs like fluoxetine as 
                              well as some calcium channel blockers. These substances 
                              should increase Nefazodone levels as well and a 
                              50% dose adjustment is general rule. Particularly, 
                              do not give with Seldane (terfenadine) and Hismanal 
                              (astemizole) - if necessary change to Claritin (Loratadine) 
                              (10 mg Claritin usually equal to 10 mg Hismanal, 
                              60 mg bid of Seldane) 
                            <p align="left">b.2. Venlafaxine (Effexor) This has 
                              the advantage of acting at both serotonin ("sledgehammer" 
                              pharmacologic) and norepinephrine ("chisel" and 
                              more physiologic) and should not produce the sexual 
                              dysfunction of the SSRIs. Its limitations relate 
                              to possible nausea, escalated blood pressure and 
                              agitation. It is logical in the retarded depressive 
                              patient. 
                            <p align="left">b.3. Bupropion (Wellbutrin): This 
                              antidepressant likely acts clinically through a 
                              somewhat irreversible norepinephric re-uptake inhibitor 
                              effect of an active metabolite hydroxy bupropion 
                              and not the dopaminergic effect previously thought. 
                              Bupropion differs from most antidepressants in its 
                              absence of effect on serotonin. Given the availability 
                              of a long-acting form, twice daily dosing is logical 
                              with a starting dose of 75 mg twice per day building 
                              if necessary to 300 mg daily. Likely choice is based 
                              on amotivation, the norepinephric effect supplementing 
                              serotonergic drugs if necessary, lack of sexual 
                              dysfunction, overweight status, and need for some 
                              activating action. 
                            <p align="left">b.4. In our opinion, the following 
                              antidepressants are not usually recommended in the

                              by some - the tricyclic antidepressant and the selective

                              potent serotonergic agonists with no way to diminish 
                              the effect other than breakdown of active compound. 
                              These drugs have two problematic common side-effects 
                              namely nausea and sexual dysfunction. They may paradoxically

                              subtypes. As such, the risk of paradoxic reactions 
                              is theoretically higher.

                              exist may be considered. NADOLOL (CORGARD) medication. 
                              Beta-blockers are useful in this instance for the 
                              somatic features of anxiety and agitation. They 
                              are not specifically FDA approved for these indications. 
                              Nadolol is suggested as the only poorly lipid soluble 
                              broad-spectrum (B1 and B2) beta-adrenergic blocker 
                              which can act peripherally and because of lack of 
                              intrinsic sympathomimetic activity can be dosed 
                              according to pulse. The dose is similar to that 
                              of propranolol (Inderal). The initial starting dose 
                              usually suggested is half 20mg tablet t.i.d. i.e. 
                              10 mg t.i.d. We suggest this be built up gradually 
                              by increasing by 10 mg every 3 days to a initial 
                              aim level of mg per day. The drug should be administered 
                              as a t.i.d. dosage and was chosen over other beta-blockers 
                              because it is not very lipid soluble (avoiding central 
                              side-effects), has both beta1 and 2 effects and 
                              has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity so that 
                              an initial titration of dose to a pulse of 66/ minute 
                              can be aimed at. Important side-effects relevant 
                              for the patient include:

                              If the response to the nadolol is partial, we suggest 
                              changing to a lipid soluble betablocker - to propranolol 
                              (Inderal) and building up to a dose of about 480 
                              mg per day or till side-effects or till pulse is 
                              = 60/minute. The change around from nadolol can 
                              be mg for mg and direct substitution from 40 mg 
                              t.i.d. nadolol to 40 mg t.i.d. of propranolol. Thereafter 
                              maintain the dose for 1 week and increase by 20mg

                              and Head injury <br>
                              There are many neurologic causes of psychosis (Table 
                              1), particularly seizure disorders and more so complex 
                              partial seizures (or temporal lobe epilepsy). This 
                              may be a possible link of the rare onset of paranoid 
                              psychosis after brief traumatic brain injury. In 
                              1963, Slater and Beard pointed out that all of the 
                              symptoms that have been observed in schizophrenic 
                              patients can occur in patients with seizure disorders. 
                              Recent efforts using standardized diagnostic rating 
                              scales have shown that the positive symptoms of 
                              the psychotic state of patients with temporal lobe 
                              seizure disorders is almost identical to schizophrenics 
                              (Trimble, 1982; Toone, 1981). Seizure disorders 
                              present with a high incidence of behavioral disturbance, 
                              which may initially be interpreted as psychiatric 
                              in origin (Neppe, Tucker, 1994). The range of behavioral 
                              symptoms is listed in Table II and most patients 
                              have only one or two of these symptoms that remain 
                              consistent over the course of the illness. (Neppe, 
                              1989 D)

                              dyskinesia (Neppe, Holden, 1989; Neppe 1989 D). 
                              Exceptions relate to the very occasional presence

                              of the CHIT. Perphenazine is approved for use in 
                              psychotic conditions. Amongst the important side-effects 
                              discussed is the long term risk of tardive dyskinesia 
                              and related syndromes and its relevance to diagnosis, 
                              dosage, duration of treatment, smoking epidemiology 
                              and the limited amounts of treatment. Anticholinergic 
                              medication is sometimes prescribed to alleviate 
                              the extra-pyramidal side-effects of neuroleptic 
                              drugs. The patient should not routinely receive 
                              anticholinergic agent with the perphenazine as this 
                              complicates pharmacokinetics, may accentuate psychosis, 
                              is usually unnecessary and disputably increases 
                              the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Additionally, anticholinergics

                              memory impairment and delirium may occur (Neppe, 
                              Ward, 1989). When there is a previous history of 
                              response to anticholinergics but with side-effects 
                              of sedation, an anticholinergic which is relatively 
                              non-sedative, has low abuse potential, and which 
                              moreover has some muscle relaxant effect, orphenadrine 
                              (Norflex) is recommended. Usual doses are 50 mg 
                              TID. If not tolerated, lower doses can be tried. 
                              A maximum of 100 mg tid should be used. The most 
                              commonly used anti-Parkinsonian anticholinergic 
                              in the USA appears to be benztropine (Cogentin).

                              Lombroso, last century wrote about the constitutional 
                              psychopath (Lombroso, 1912). Sociologists and behaviorist 
                              psychologists claimed that there were no such constitutional 
                              givens and that all behavior was socially determined 
                              totally ignoring the organism. We have now returned 
                              to the stage where constitutional and biologic components 
                              have again become important and well demonstrated 
                              in our conceptualization of transient traumatic
