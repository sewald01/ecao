<H1>Mental Status Examination</H1>

<P>
Just as neurologic evaluation is critical to finding subtle deficits, mental
status evaluation is the key to a successful psychiatric evaluation and can
reflect pathology that may be symptomatic of the CHIT.
</P>
 
<P>
This is performed sequentially on several occasions along the time based
examination.
</P>

<P>
There are many different ways of performing the <I>mental status examination</I>
in neuropsychiatry. No one technique is necessarily better than another.
</P>
 
<P>
We approach mental status by making sure the major aspects are prioritized. The
special structure involves mnemonics as a helpful <I>means</I> to recall items
otherwise forgotten.
</P>
 
<P>
In mental status evaluations, the special skill is to be as flexible as
possible. Some mental status headings are ambiguous as you can, for example,
describe certain signs under a person's appearance and very often, the same
features could equally well relate to the patient's affect - the appearance
of the patient may be sad and that same sadness should be picked up with regard
to his emotions.
</P>
 
<P>
The mental status examination in psychiatry is the equivalent of the
<I>physical examination</I> in general medicine.  Both logically follow the 
taking of a medical <I>history</I>. This elicits as much information as
possible and prioritizes what needs to be evaluated; then you examine the
patient. There is a fundamental difference, however: much of the psychiatric
examination is performed by taking a history - this is a special skill itself
as the two functions of history and examination are therefore performed
simultaneously and sequentially.
</P>
 
<P>
Often the mental status <I>examination</I> is confused with <I>history
taking</I>. For example, when the patient gives historical information,
he may not admit to any hallucinations: this may or may not be true;
this is not part of the mental status examination.  It is part of the
mental status <I>evaluation</I>.  It is clearly important to inquire
about hallucinatory experiences, but asking about hallucinatory
experience may get the response, "No, I never hear voices," when the
patient is floridly hallucinating. The patient may or may not tell you
about the voices he is hearing. Alternatively, he may describe voices
he does not hear to ensure conscious or unconscious gains like
admission to hospital (and a warm bed and caring environment) as well
as fulfilling dependency needs. In the CHIT patient, where medicolegal
facets are often relevant, particular attention should be paid
to possible dissimulation or malingering.
</P>
 
<P>
We should distinguish between the historical mental status evaluation, which
consists of the <I>symptom cluster</I> descriptions relevant to mental status,
and the <I>mental status examination,</I>  that component of evaluation often

mental status.

History taking involves probing. This is often facilitated by basic techniques
or maneuvers that occur during the interview.  Very often,  history-taking
involves eliciting both symptoms and signs: to do so,  the skilled
examiner, as required by the demands of the situation, shifts his
interaction with the patient. This involves performing frequent probes,
and keenly observing the response that results.  These have both
<I>content and process</I> components:
</P>
 
<P>
The single major mnemonic for mental status is
<A HREF="#acclaimed">ACCLAIMED</A>. In the CHIT we
evaluate the nine major subheadings of ACCLAIMED. In these nine major
subheadings, which imply the essence of every facet of the mental
status examination.  The order of this mnemonic was empirically derived
from the most logical direction to do the mental status examination; it
is not contrived with headings made to fit the mnemonic.  ACCLAIMED
constitutes a priority system for the larger of the headings of mental
status examination.
