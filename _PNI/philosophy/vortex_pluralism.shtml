                            <h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
                            This paper proposes a radical, new mind-body theory 
                            involving perceiving the mind and body link dilemma 
                            as neither being dualistic or monistic. Instead, mind 
                            and body reflect part of a grander pluralistic design, 
                            with a gradual process of diminishing density in infinite 
                            dimensional vortices impacting at specific points 
                            which are partly observer dependent interwoven with 
                            a broader existence. Simplistically, the model of 
                            a spinning top allows the subject to experience the 
                            vortices at specific defined points in an N dimensional 
                            space-time universe allowing meeting points for such 
                            phenomena as precognition, survival after bodily death, 
                            and mind-brain. This theory appears tenable using 
                            natural scientific models ranging from psychology 
                            and the unconscious to genetics, quantum physics and 
                            relativity, astronomy , chemistry, anthropology, religion, 
                            philosophy, sociology and biology, physiology and 
                            anatomy. Theories pertaining to numerous concepts 
                            and ideas such as overlaps, parallel universe and 
                            holograms; nanosecond biology, molecular interaction, 
                            circular motion and crystal structure; vibrations, 
                            density and frequency; spatial gaps, observer-observed, 
                            minuscule-macropedic differences, parallel and non-parallel 
                            vortices; are all workable within the vortex pluralism 
                            framework. The external unconsciousness model, temporal 
                            lobe, helices, electrical wiring and nerves, paranormality, 
                            survival communication, meditation, death, free-will, 
                            psychokinesis, out-of-body experience and extrasensory 
                            perception are also all impacted within this all encompassing 
                            fundamental theory. </div>
                          <H2 align="left">The Theory of Vortex Pluralism</H2>
                          <P align="left"> Experiences in coma apparently knowing 
                            events that happened in for example an operating room 
                            require such radical alterations of conventional thinking 
                            in relation to memory, for example that they shake 
                            the entire basis for the physicalistic presupposition 
                            as the only basis for reality. My approach therefore 
                            had been to shift away from monism initially to a 
                            conventional Cartesian dualism. But an interface area 
                            such as an unpaired gland in the brain like the pineal 
                            is rather simplistic (other unpaired glands equivalently 
                            are the hypothalamus and pituitary and all of these 
                            have two sides in any event). If there is an interface 
                            area of mind and brain at that dualistic kind of level 
                            one logical interface area may well be the temporal 
                            lobe of the brain. How does such an interface work, 
                            however? </P>
                          <P align="left"> Consequently, the important component 
                            in my theory is a shift in context not to dualism 
                            or to three frameworks of a kind of trialism but to 
                            go to an N- dimensional pluralism. We have three spatial 
                            dimensions and one time dimension. Beyond that there 
                            must be a further dimension. And beyond that a further 
                            dimension, ultimately producing an infinite number 
                            or N-dimensional kind of universe. In this same framework, 
                            we explain events occurring in one reality but not 
                            within another reality. This implies some kind of 
                            point or existence impinging on the two (or more) 
                            realities with a different kind of level . It seemed 
                            to me logical to use the framework of the spinning 
                            top as an initial parallel. The spinning top becomes 
                            less and less dense the further from its center . 
                            Depending on particular points it allows views of 
                            a reality which would be different from our physicalistic 
                            views which at a simplistic level may be centered 
                            at the bottom point of the top (or the bottom part 
                            of a vortex for that matter). But in reality, it may 
                            be centered anywhere because there has to be an infinite 
                            number of vortices all running in parallel and non-parallel 
                            and all interfacing at a variety of different levels. 
                            What arises therefore is a vortex pluralism implying 
                            an infinite number of dimensions and an infinite number 
                            of vortices interfacing like spinning tops on each 
                            other with differences in terms of density ultimately 
                            producing therefore a non-physical reality with points 
                            of interface potentially and yet no points of interface 
                            in another kind of dimensional framework depending 
                            upon the observer's perspective. </P>
                          <P align="left"> A vortex technically is "a spiral motion 
                            of fluid occurring within a limited area, especially 
                            a whirling mass of water or air that sucks everything 
                            near it towards its center." It has broader meanings, 
                            for example, "a place or situation regarded as a drawing 
                            into its center all that surrounds it" (example from 
                            the American Heritage Dictionary quoting the New York 
                            Times) as happened with so many theater actors: He 
                            was swept up in the vortex of Hollywood. Vortex here 
                            is used in its broadest sense as it does not imply 
                            water, nor does it imply air, however, it does not 
                            have a context of an N-dimensional place or situation. 
                            It does have a context of a center being potentially 
                            denser than surrounding areas. Furthermore, it has 
                            a context of motion and movement and it implies some 
                            kind of circular of ovoid as opposed to rectangular 
                            motion. It is a useful way to perceive a philosophic 
                            concept which is beyond our dimensional perceptions 
                            of time and space. </P>

                          <P align="left"> The hypothesis of vortex pluralism 
                            is therefore conceptualized with a larger helical 
                            expansion outwards and greater emptiness in that outward 
                            expansion . Yet there are the parallels of the N-dimensional 
                            rubric like spinning tops vibrating reflecting properties 
                            conceptualized in space, speed, density and time. 
                            Fundamental is relativism to the observer of this 
                            multi-dimensional framework moving from the smallest 
                            to the largest of time, space, size and density, and 
                            nanosecond events and nanosphere biology all being 
                            relative concepts, and of our conventional concept 
                            of consciousness outside being wrong. </P>
