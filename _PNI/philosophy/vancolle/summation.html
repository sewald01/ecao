                            <PRE>I am fully aware of the fact that the <A HREF="http://www.pni.org/philosophy/vancolle/assumptions.html">25 &quot;assumptions&quot;</A> that I have
set out are, of course, far from approaching anything which could be called
complete. However, I feel do they form a useful basis for putting forward 
a simple MODEL, something for Mr.&amp; Mrs. Everyman, whose criticisms I need and will
welcome. I feel that by setting out the model, it will be a way of
joining together the various &quot;assumptions&quot;, instead of having them
representing an unconnected set of views. But again I must emphasise that
this &quot;globe of the world&quot; which I am attempting to create is made up of
&quot;parts&quot; which are all of small and equal scale. So here goes :

                              <LI>WHY ARE WE HERE ? People have put to me some 
                                &quot;explanations&quot; about why we (also the 
                                plant and animal kingdoms) were created. Quite 
                                honestly the little<BR>
                                that was said made no real sense to me, so long 
                                ago I abandoned asking &quot;why<BR>
                                ?&quot;, and instead substituted &quot;now we 
                                are here (fact), which is the best way<BR>
                                to live out lives ?&quot;. I am sure that if the 
                                question is posed to a variety<BR>
                                of people, there will be a variety of opinions. 
                                For me I have found that if<BR>
                                my activities on this earth lead to others becoming 
                                a little happier and<BR>
                                are able to cope with this puzzling life, then 
                                somehow I get a sense of<BR>
                                fulfilment, that my existence is justified. The 
                                only answer to my &quot;why?&quot;<BR>
                                that enables me to stop asking is that I accept 
                                that there is,<BR>
                                undoubtedly, a &quot;power&quot; or &quot;creative 
                                force&quot; in existence beyond my ability<BR>
                                to comprehend. To that I give the label God (22), 
                                and that is my only<BR>
                                belief. Otherwise I either know, by experience 
                                and reason (22), or I don't<BR>
                                know. Where being human is concerned, I do not 
                                demand scientific proof of<BR>
                                things which my reason tells me are unprovable, 
                                nor about matters which are<BR>
                                essentially instinctive, instincts being incorporated 
                                within the records of<BR>
                                the brain (20). 
                              <LI>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF UNDERSTANDING. I am frequently 
                                asked why I think<BR>
                                &quot;understanding&quot; is helpful in living 
                                one's life, and making living more<BR>
                                meaningful. The answer is that by simply understanding 
                                &quot;cause and probable<BR>
                                effect&quot;(24), it facilitates decision-making 
                                (something that we are called<BR>
                                upon to do almost every few minutes of every day), 
                                it enables us to<BR>
                                understand how to do things more easily and efficiently, 
                                to avoid creating<BR>
                                stress (15). And perhaps, most important of all, 
                                by understanding how<BR>
                                humans function in general, it helps us to form 
                                relationships with others<BR>
                                (11), even to feel the need to love people. 
                              <LI>NATURE'S INTENTION. Nature's prime intention 
                                is for the SURVIVAL of<BR>
                                creations. There would be no such thing as creation 
                                of each creation did<BR>
                                not have some period of survival, no matter how 
                                brief. But humans are<BR>
                                mortal, and mortality is the only human certainty 
                                after birth. When I was a<BR>

                                as a form of limited thinking. Therefore animals

                                primarily for survival. For that reason most animals 
                                do not display some of<BR>
                                the undesirable qualities seen in humans e.g.

                                great deal before he/she learns. The trouble is 
                                that he/she is causing<BR>
                                havoc to Earth's environment and, in terms of 
                                the earth's history, in a<BR>

                                created, he/she has to do a lot of things that

                                &quot;man's&quot; survival as a species , and 
                                that those in power via money,<BR>
                                politics, industry, etc. have a tremendous vested

                                himself, his EGO, and if one thinks about it carefully 
                                it is easy to see<BR>
                                how ego manifests itself in the most destructive 
                                way, either in the form of<BR>
                                individualism, nationalism, religion, culture 
                                etc.&quot;Man&quot; perpetrates some of<BR>

                                physical survival, &quot;man&quot; now strives

                                difficult to pick from history some of the awful 
                                consequences of &quot;ego<BR>
                                defence&quot; and &quot;ego domination&quot;,

                                ultimate model, simply because I feel that so

                                that this model is backed by my 25 (so far) &quot;reasonable

                                hope that this simple model will cause readers

                                WITHOUT ENLARGING THE SCALE, will make suggestions
