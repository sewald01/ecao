                            I want to put forward some ideas with a view<BR>
                            to the ultimate construction of a MODEL to explain, 
                            as far as possible,<BR>
                            human behaviour and experiences (including some &quot;paranormal&quot;) 
                            by<BR>
                            incorporating &quot;REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS&quot; where 
                            the purely scientific model is<BR>
                            lacking. I welcome criticisms and alternative suggestions, 
                            hoping<BR>
                            that SIMPLICITY will be a feature so that the maximum 
                            number of people will<BR>
                            be able to understand, both lay and professional. 
                            Simple ideas can always<BR>
                            be expanded into more complex ones in the minds of 
                            those who wish to do so.</P>
                          <P align="left">When considering my &quot;reasonable

                            attempting to join them together is important to show 
                            their<BR>
                            interrelationship. Also extrapolation is important 
                            to see the relevance of an idea in<BR>
                            other situations. But I must emphasise that I do not 
                            regard my ideas a<BR>
                            &quot;final statements&quot;, only ideas to be &quot;kicked 
                            around&quot;, criticised and<BR>
                            improved if possible, always with the creation of 
                            a model in mind.</P>
                          <P align="left">These ideas have developed over many 
                            years . I write them in as logical a sequence as I<BR>

                            alterations and<BR>
                            alternative suggestions need to be stated, but also 
                            some re-arrangement to<BR>
                            make the emergence of a model more visible, then of

                          <P align="left">1. DOMINATION. This concept is basic. 
                            It is a relative term, and can be<BR>
                            applied to almost anything in Nature. In particular 
                            it is an essential<BR>
                            consideration in respect of the functioning of the 
                            brain-mind system, and<BR>

                            response activity. It came to my<BR>
                            mind during dowsing experiments. An example in Nature 
                            is the effect of<BR>
                            sunlight upon the eyes of the viewer. In daylight 
                            it dominates the viewer's<BR>
                            eyes which then apply a restrictive mechanism to prevent 
                            damage, and in so<BR>
                            doing prevents seeing the weaker light of the stars.</P>
                          <P align="left">2. &quot;UFX&quot; (Universal Field

                            pub counter he feels someone might drink it. So he 
                            puts a note beneath the<BR>

                            also bears the words &quot;Me too&quot;. Probably 
                            both statements were untrue, but<BR>
                            if his mind believes it, he certainly wont fancy drinking

                            are the INHERITED records associated with survival, 
                            enabling babies to<BR>
                            &quot;know&quot; how to suckle, and to control their

                            important ways. Inherited records also contain information

                            physical features , strengths/weaknesses, potential

                            events in the living organism, which must be regarded 
                            as unique, and<BR>
                            therefore indefinable in terms of anything else, but 
                            which can perhaps be<BR>
                            best described as a view of these processes or events, 
                            as it were, from the<BR>
                            inside --- the individual is, as it were, inside what 
                            is happening; the<BR>
                            adjective 'conscious', is ordinarily employed as a 
                            synonym for 'aware' ,<BR>
                            but this is a popular rather than scientific usage.&quot;</P>
                          <P align="left">Quite obviously, while some aspects 
                            of &quot;awareness&quot; could be considered as<BR>
                            consciousness for humans, it must be remembered that 
                            both plants and<BR>
                            animals possess that ability, stemming from one of 
                            the &quot;inherited records&quot;<BR>
                            mentioned earlier, and giving rise to instincts for 
                            the purpose of<BR>
                            survival. So it is that plants, for example, have 
                            awareness of water,<BR>
                            light, temperature etc., and animals have awareness 
                            of danger, water and<BR>
                            food. They have additional awareness of role, rank 
                            and function. Animals of<BR>
                            the higher order display recognisable love etc. One 
                            essential difference I<BR>
                            feel between animals and humans is SELF-AWARENESS, 
                            although, perhaps, some<BR>
                            animals which seem to have more &quot;intelligence&quot; 
                            than others, might have a<BR>
                            degree of self-awareness. Some humans have the ability 
                            to be consciously<BR>
                            aware of more things than others, the reason being 
                            directly linked to the<BR>
                            critical faculty.</P>
                          <P align="left">So, where humans are concerned, if a 
                            person is consciously aware of some<BR>
                            particular thing externally, or is mentally preoccupied 
                            with something in<BR>
                            his mind, depending upon the extent of that mental 
                            attention, so will other<BR>
                            events or objects be involved to a lesser extent in 
                            his mind. In my view,<BR>
                            so far as human consciousness is concerned, his awareness 
                            of himself and<BR>
                            the world around, the universe, love, other people, 
                            even his own bodily<BR>
                            functioning, etc.etc is solely dependent upon the 
                            operation of his critical<BR>
                            faculty or the extent of its non- or lesser activity. 
                            So it has been<BR>
                            observed that there are several states of consciousness 
                            in &quot;man&quot;, and those<BR>
                            states are linked, I feel sure, with the extent of 
                            the activity of the<BR>
                            critical faculty. In an &quot;altered state of consciousness&quot; 
                            -- as<BR>
                            illustrated by hypnosis -- the critical faculty is 
                            very diminished,<BR>
                            possibly non-existent in some cases, which means that 
                            the hypnotised person<BR>
                            has little or no mental preoccupation and is paying 
                            more attention, and<BR>
                            therefore the route is open to creating more powerful 
                            records (more<BR>
                            dominating) in the brain. There are other methods 
                            of achieving altered<BR>
                            states of consciousness e.g.transcendental meditation, 
                            chanting etc., in<BR>
                            which case the brain- mind system of the person will 
                            be in a position of<BR>
                            greater awareness and receptiveness.</P>
