 <br>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Words…words…words…and 
new words, to boot. But in my personal exploration, these neologisms—new 
words—must be valuable: they must be unique, they must transmit new 
ideas, novel concepts, and innovative ways of communicating yet be intuitive 
enough in verbalization that their meaning is implied. These have been 
the evolutionary challenges for inventing new neologisms.</font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A 
neologism (from Greek neo = &quot;new&quot; + logos = &quot;word&quot; 
+ ismos = “state”) is a word or phrase that, although devised relatively 
recently in a specific time period, has not been accepted into a mainstream 
language. By definition, neologisms are &quot;new&quot;, and as such 
are often directly attributable to a specific individual, publication, 
period, or event. The term &quot;neologism&quot; was coined in 1803.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What 
makes my own personal voyage into the neologism domain of language so 
exciting?</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is because my first loves 
are creative theorizing, conceptualization, and pragmatic empiricism…and 
ostensible neologisms—but only when worthwhile—are integral components 
of advancement in this romantic sojourn. So, onward with our travels!</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I 
give just a tiny taste of the sheer beauty—the remarkable splendor 
of the area. I have chosen three vignettes reflecting usage in “normal” 
individuals: the ultralengthy word, the evolutional outreach of new 
twentieth century science, and scientific phenomenological applications 
of a foreign language concept. These are contrasted with the fourth, 
the psychopathological approach to neologisms In each there is the taste 
of what was and what is reflecting personal creative contribution. </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I 
focus on English. Evolutionally, there has been a change in spelling 
as well as grammatical and word usage over time. There have even been 
the cultural perspectives: Americanese has possibly a thousand different 
words today, in addition, to classical British English. Add in new words 
in South African, Australian, Canadian, Indian and other colonial English 
variants and we</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>5</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> already have the evolution over time 
of the English language with abundant neologisms—all commonly applied, 
recently coined words or phrases or recently extended meanings of existing 
words or phrases. </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
Norman Conquest swept away the regular spelling system of Old English. 
Then English itself was eclipsed by the French for three centuries. 
Therefore, English spelling became significantly influenced by French. 
Also, many century old neologisms are derivations of spelling of Middle 
English, such as in the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer; These are commonly 
very irregular and inconsistent. </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>7</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> As an addition, we see derivations 
from many other sources: South African English leans heavily on the 
Dutch and, to some degree, the German. And classical English has, of 
course, direct derivations from Latin and Greek. There are more recently 
numerous Yiddish words that have crept into English. Currently, English 
spelling is perceived (<i>as in this word, I before E except after C</i>) 
as one of the most irregular spelling systems. Although French encoded 
writing may even be more difficult, English decoding (reading) is more 
difficult. English has never had any formal regulating authority, like 
the Spanish Real Academia Española, Italian Accademia Della Crusca 
or the French Académie Française, so attempts to regularize have been 
limited. </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>8</sup></font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">William 
of Ockham (1287–1347) enunciated a methodological principle that has 
application even today: <i>“Occam’s razor”</i> </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>9</i></sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. This emphasizes cautious discretion 
before creating new terms and concepts.</font></p>
<ul>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Parsimony</i> 
  implies that philosophy and science should assume as few theoretical 
  entities as possible for purposes of explanation, explication and definition </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> <i>Simplicity</i> 
  (economy of thinking </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>10</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">) aims at explanations, reasons and 
  theories, etc., should be as simple as possible. This implies a <i>utility </i>

  to any new concepts.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Necessity </i>
  implies minimal-step explanations—exclusion of unnecessary additional 
  hypotheses.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Occam’s razor </i>
opposes otherwise meaningless and superfluous terms. New words should 
be useful, applicable and necessary. Today, we realize that we should 
have a functional, sufficiently differentiated system of terms (e.g., 
as in <i>déjà experiences</i> below) but we also warn against neologisms 
“beyond a necessary scale”. Stupid terminology sometimes occurs 
as a “show vocabulary” within new fields of science struggling for 
recognition: These should be avoided.</font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Today, 
too, we realize that Occam’s razor contains some myths: For example, 
renowned parapsychologist, Charley Tart speaks of <i>pseudoparsimony </i>
where the most parsimonious explanation is not the correct one —e.g., 
as in the <i>out-of-body experience</i> (another term developed by Dr 
Tart). Similarly, “simplicity” often cannot be sustained.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>11</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
This is so as it cannot help toward a rational decision between competing 
explanations of the same empirical facts.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let 
us examine the challenge of the longest English word and the neologistic 
pretenders to that throne. We will then continue very briefly to examine 
illustrative neologisms that I’ve suggested in two disciplines simply 
to illustrate the modern approach to new word formation, all the while 
bearing in mind the philosophical underpinnings of Ockham and his subsequent 
critics. I am deliberately avoiding detail, although citing the original 
sources for those interested in pursuing why the specific terms were 
motivated, and their special characteristics. Of thousands of potential 
illustrative contexts, I have chosen four illustrative personal interest 
topics:</font></p>
<ul>

<ol type="1">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Very long words, 
  for curiosity: This is an illustration not only of an area I find stimulating, 
  but which has a definite history that has impacted through to even my 
  own personal interventions.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Medicine, as a constantly 
  growing sturdy foundation science: It uses empiricism and theory.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Phenomenology, specifically 
  demonstrating how detailed analysis generates neologisms: the example 
  of the <i>déjà vu phenomenon</i> is doubly apposite, as it also illustrates 
  neologism translation from another language (French). </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The neuropsychiatric 
  uses reflecting the use of new words in the “abnormal” context: 
  “neologism” becomes a different animal, less simple, parsimonious 
  and necessary. </font></li>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What 
is the longest word in the English language? This was a common riddle 
I would hear as a child of the 1950s and 1960s. Rather proudly the response 
would be mile because it was a mile long; but then the question was 
can we pluralize it? Hence, miles. Then came the answer to the riddle: 
if MILES is so long, then adding an “S” makes it longer, hence the 
answer was<i> smiles</i>. I always felt that the riddle answer was incorrect 
and certainly the 21<sup>st</sup> century equivalent would be<i> light-year, 
light-years </i>and then add on the “s” and make is<i> slight-years</i>! </font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
In actual fact, long words were rather unusual until William Shakespeare 
came up with his <i>honorificabilitudinitatibus</i>, and thereafter 
there have been various challenges as words have become longer and longer. 
There is a fascinating history here, of questionable genuineness. The 
origin, of course, is in the bard’s play, <i>Love&#39;s Labours Lost</i>, 
Costard, the witty clown who drives the sub-plot of the play, criticizes 
the loquaciousness of Don Adriano de Armado and schoolmaster Holofernes:</font></p>

27 letters) became certainly then the longest word in English literature. 
&quot;Honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; was arguably an English word 
only because William Shakespeare used it. Yet, here is the evolutional 
controversy: theorists over time hypothesized that Shakespeare was actually 
Francis Bacon. &quot;Honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; was not quite 
the nonsense word it appears but written by Bacon as an encrypted anagram 
to his readers Bacon: <i>&quot;hi ludi F. Baconis nati tuiti orbi&quot;</i>, 
meaning <i>&quot;these plays born of F. Bacon are preserved for the 
world.</i>&quot; Is this purely a meaningful playful coincidence or 
a more sinister term? Certainly the neologism at that time &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; 

is the dative singular conjugation of a real Medieval Latin word. Dante 
actually used it more than once, as did other writers of the period. 
A translation of it would be “the state of being able to achieve honors.”</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let 
us now examine the modern pretenders to the throne of the longest word: </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let’s 
first venture into such obscure lexicographical neologisms.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For a long time the term <i>
antidisestablishmentarianism </i>referring to a movement opposed to 
the separation of church and state at 28 letters was popularly believed 
to be the longest word. A friend of mine once suggested adding prefixes 
like “anti” (just as was done in <i>antidisestablishmentarianism</i> 
to this but that becomes a worthless extra term (indeed we could apply <i>

antifloccinaucinihilipilificat<WBR>ion</i> and others have also added <i>
–ity</i> but this is just ridiculous letter building). </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But 
surely <i>antidisestablishmentarianism</i> had beaten out the puny 27 
lettered <i>&quot;Honorificabilitudinitatibus</i>”. But this was never 
so because of <i>&quot;<WBR>floccinaucinihilipilification&quot;</i> (29 letters)<i>. </i>

This word has been around more than two and a half centuries and was 
listed in Oxford English Dictionary for many years</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>16</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. It is thought to have developed in 
1741<i> </i>referring to &quot;the act of estimating as worthless!&quot;—a 
term of unlikely value. Nevertheless, possibly because of its sheer 
length, it was used in recent times in the proceedings of the US Senate 
(Senator Jesse Helms in 1999 during the debate on the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty [Randolph V. Cinco]) and at the White House</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>17</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ironically, 
in my preface to my 1989 book, “<i>Innovative Psychopharmacotherapy” </i>
(at 21 letters possibly still the longest word in a book title) an equivalent 
length word derivation was born, namely<i> biopsychofamiliosociocultural</i> </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>18</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. 
It was equal tied in length with<i> floccinaucinihilipilification</i> 

at 29 letters tied as the longest English word at the time. The tie 
was which means estimating worthlessness! Unlike the literal worthlessness 
of “<WBR>floccinaucinihilipilification”<WBR>, the immediate and valuable meaning 
in medical systems theory of “<WBR>biopsychofamiliosociocultural” was 
apparent to readers. </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“<WBR>Biopsychofamiliosociocultural” 
had a relatively short tenure as the equal longest word in English. 
Webster’s dictionary began to list a word that had caught the public 
imagination in the song title version of the movie, Mary Poppins. The 
mere 34 letters of <i>supercalifragilisticexpialidoc<WBR>ious</i> referring 
to a miraculous way to talk one&#39;s self out of difficult situations and 
even a way to change one&#39;s mood, almost became the longest, legitimate 
word! However, Webster’s listed it only as a proper noun: Hence it 
could be dismissed as a &quot;real&quot; word. (Along the same lines, 
the character Big Bird of Sesame Street sings the Latin alphabet regarding 
it is a word as <i>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. </i>

Aloud as &quot;(ab-cud-ef-gï)(jek&#39;l-m&#39;nâp-<WBR>kwûr)(stööv-wik-ziz)&quot; 
it breaks into song. Of course, these are not real words.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But 
again “<WBR>supercalifragilisticexpialidoc<WBR>ious” has been short-lived 
as the longest English word. I developed an important extension of “<WBR>biopsychofamiliosociocultural”<WBR>. 
I realized that besides the biological, psychological, family, social 
and cultural approaches to psychopathology and functionality, there 
was a need for an ethical base. A new pretender to the throne of the 
longest word involved adding ethico- to biopsychofamiliosociocultural: <i>
ethicobiopsychofamiliosociocul<WBR>tural </i>

(at 35 letters) or if you want<i> ethico<a name="0.1.1_OLE_LINK2"></a>biopsychofamiliosociocul<WBR>turally </i>
(at 37 letters) and <i>ethicobiofamiliosocioculturali<WBR>ty </i>
(at 38 letters) technically became the longest published word in the 
English language—excluding non-existent or illogical medical conditions 
that had been posited. The word <i>ethicobiopsychofamiliosociocul<WBR>tural</i> 
appears in my book, “<i>Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hop</i>e” 
(originally in the late 1990s)<i> </i>

and became technically the longest used and published real word in the 
English language</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>19</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> (but try to tell that to Webster’s 
who still wanted to see its common usage before they list it —I believe 
it now has achieved common, easily comprehensible, valuable use for 
an extended period of time.—I suspect on re-examination now it would 
have to be accepted.) It’s particularly fashionable because the social 
sciences emphasize the multisystems approach and it’s principles are 
commonly applied.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">More 
recently I added <i>spirituo-</i>, discussing this in a closed email 
group of scientists who appear to regard it as valuable: Hence the development 
of a term that received the following response and consequent dialog: 
“…this wonderful term: <a name="0.1.1__Hlk94145327"></a><i>Ethicospirituobiopsychofamilio<WBR>sociocultural</i> 
(alternatively,<i> Ethicobiopsychofamiliospirituo<WBR>sociocultural)</i> 

(43 letters)…” … Is there an even longer term that suggests the 
holistic (systems, scientific) nature of the world? If someone asks 
what I study, I can give them an impressive sounding name with 20 or 
30 syllables?”</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This 
brought me to an earlier well received suggestion I had already made: 
We could add extra components  e.g., <i>politicospirituomilitaroeconom<WBR>o—</i>, <i> </i>
though I saw no immediate heuristic relevance; similarly, <i>pharmacophysicochemical</i> 
could be  relevant for systems theory. Historically (3/23/2007), 
I had suggested to the American Psychiatric Association email group </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>ethicobiopsychofamiliosociopol<WBR>iticospirituocultural</i> 

(51 letters), later pointing out there is a place for this approach 
to delusions. “For completeness, we could add<i> militaro</i>- as 
an important context, and <i>economo-</i> as economic type delusional 
thoughts of worthlessness or grandeur are not uncommon (the millionaire 
who regards himself as penniless, the manic patient who thinks she is 
richer than anyone in the world).”  I proposed an 80-letter alternative 
bordering on ridiculous: <i>ethicospirituobiopsychopharama<WBR>cofamiliosocioculturaloeconomi<WBR>copoliticomilitarality, </i>
with the variants: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>ethicospirituobiopsychopharama<WBR>cofamiliosocioculturaloeconomi<WBR>copoliticomilitaral </i>

as adjective (77 letters)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>ethicospirituobiopsychopharama<WBR>cofamiliosocioculturaloeconomi<WBR>copoliticomilitarally</i> 
as adverb (79 letters) using scientifically the noun, adjective and 
adverb. Thereafter, these words were published in <i>Telicom</i> on 
paroxysmal disorders. “<i>Putting these different system levels together, 
we have the ethicobiopsychofamiliosociocul<WBR>tural framework for paroxysmal 
conditions, as well as any other medical condition. Indeed, we can make 
this a basis for the various different systems approaches…Ultimately, 
one may find a time where one is applying more systems</i> <i>and it 
would then not be inappropriate to talk about (this 80-letter) approach. 
Clearly such words have adverbs, nouns and adjectives </i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>20</i></sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i> 
Lengthy terms such as these must be meaningful in context and the broadest 
approach in a military communist dictatorship may allow appropriate 
use of such terms! But not here… All of these are not just a variety 
of different terms put together, but reflect our various systems approaches 
and the unity not only of medicine, but of all our thinking.</i> <i>

The ethics relates to our need to act to assist individuals who are 
photosensitive from becoming ill. Initially at least as a society, putting 
up appropriate warnings and realizing that the cultural fabric of flashing 
lights for fun may be harmful. All paroxysmal conditions, be they epileptic 
seizures, paroxysmal somatoform disorder or paroxysmal neurobehavioral 
disorder all have biological bases, require pharmacotherapy in approach 
and appropriate psychological management and understanding.” </i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>21</i></sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We 
could further add <i>pharmaco-</i> based on medication responsiveness 
and <i>physicochemical</i> as fundamental science so , they include 
the extra legitimate components above respectively making them 91, 93 
and 94 letters long using thirteen fundamental areas of systems theory:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>ethicospirituobiopsychophysico<WBR>chemicalpharamacofamilioleconi<WBR>mopoliticomilitarosociocultura<WBR>l; </i>

 </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>ethicospirituobiopsychophysico<WBR>chemicalpharamacofamilioleconi<WBR>mopoliticomilitarosociocultura<WBR>lly;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>ethicospirituobiopsychophysico<WBR>chemicalpharamacofamilioleconi<WBR>mopoliticomilitarosociocultura<WBR>lity. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">These various subsystems can 
be interchanged in order to emphasize certain aspects— for example, 
the position of <i>spirituo- </i>can be relocated in these various words 
as can <i>physicochemical</i> or <i>pharmaco-</i> dependent on emphases. 
Systems theory is critical. </font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">These 
terms still reflect a very meaningful and useful systems approach. Systems 
theory has become critically important in the social and medical sciences. 
I think the essence of such lengthy words has to be their utility and 
this certainly has utility in many different systems approaches in the 
social, medical and parapsychological scientific areas. This is as opposed 
to extra additions unlikely to be useful terms reflected, of course, 
by other potentially multifaceted systems each useful within their scientific 
endeavor but collectively irrelevant: e.g.,</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>empiricotheoreticoscientificom<WBR>athematicologicophilisophicoli<WBR>nguisticoquantoastronomicogeol<WBR>ogicophysicochemicoethicospiri<WBR>tuoneuroanatomicophysiologicop<WBR>athologiconutritionopharmacolo<WBR>gicotherapeuticomedicobiopsych<WBR>ofamiliosociopoliticomilitaroe<WBR>conomogeographicoculturalness. </i>
At 270 letters, this theoretical yet potentially comprehensible scientific 
word reflecting “approaches to all knowledge” would be such a monster 
of multiple completely different systems theories, that it would be 
unlikely to be used relevantly in one particular scientific endeavor 
and as inappropriate as a lengthy chemical formula. The same would apply 
to other hybrids of even lengthier kind. I therefore discount such terms. 
The utility of these 200+ letter words, even if meaningful, would compromise 
meaning and impede sentence comprehension, slow reading speed and diminish 
the meaning of the individual word. These sesquipedalian neologisms 
could logically/ scientifically be even longer but remain linguistically 
inappropriate.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
are some more ultralengthy words even if they don&#39;t count: the longest 
word cited by the Guinness Book of Records, allegedly represents the 
name for human mitochondrial DNA, and is 207,000+ letters long. This 
is unacceptable as a regular English word — proper technical names 
plus strings of chemicals exclude it. Ditto for the longest hypothetically 
legal Scrabble word (&gt;15 letters, the Scrabble board width) in North 
American play, namely <i>ethylenediaminetetraacetates</i> (28 letters). 
This is the plural of a word found in Merriam-Webster&#39;s Collegiate Dictionary, 
10th edition (previously a dictionary of reference in North American 
Scrabble play). Similarly, <i>Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwy<WBR>rndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch</i> 

(58 letters)) (“church of St. Mary in the hollow of white hazel trees 
near the rapid whirlpool by St. Tysilio&#39;s of the red cave&quot;) as 
a contrived proper noun is excluded.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Finally, 
I mention a historical error; <i>Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilico<WBR>volcanoconiosis</i> 
was supposedly a lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine 
silica dust. At 45 letters it was the longest word ever to appear in 
an English non-technical dictionary (Oxford English Dictionary, 1936; 
subsequently in Webster&#39;s New International Dictionary—under the alternate 
spelling of -konioisis, the Random House Unabridged Dictionary and the 
Merriam-Webster&#39;s Collegiate Dictionary)</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>22</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. However, this word is a technical 
medical term therefore excluding it the &quot;longest word in general 
usage&quot;. Moreover, the word is a hoax</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>23</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">,<i> </i>

a neologism invented in 1935 by Everett M. Smith, President of the National 
Puzzler&#39;s League, as an example of a theoretical word that might one 
day enter use if trends in medical word coinage were to continue. Research 
prior to this never successfully showed the word existed and there is 
no medical condition. </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So 
the bottom line is the longest regular and meaningful word in the English 
language in both common usage, and that appears in any book is my term<i> 
ethicobiopsychofamiliosociocul<WBR>tural</i> with various grammatical alternatives 
(-ally; -ality; -alness). I believe a better, more logically inclusive, 
useful term may be <i>ethicospirituobiopsychofamilio<WBR>sociopoliticocultural</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Monster terms can be made, 
but we must ensure adequacy of meaning and relevant application within 
the contextual subculture.</font></p>

The Evolutional Outreach of Twentieth Century Science—Illustrative 
Medical Terminology (Part 3).</i> </b></font><font size="5" face="Times"><sup><b>24</b></sup></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>“</b><i>No 
new science is possible without neologisms, new words or new interpretations 
of old words to describe and explain reality in new ways.” </i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>25</i></sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
Ingar Roggen: Root knowledge. </font></p>
 <br>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">New 
medical diagnoses (conditions) and symptom clusters (syndromes) are 
legitimate approaches to neologisms. Possibly the most famous recent 
new diagnosis is <i>MRSA</i> or <i>Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus 
Aureus</i> infection. Awareness of such conditions enhances appropriate 
medical practice provided they are legitimate, logical and fill a void. 
They become the simplest, most parsimonious explanations! </font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Recently 
in Telecom I described several new terms, corresponding with new medical 
paroxysmal (episodic brain re1ated) <i>conditions</i> namely: <i>Paroxysmal 
neurobehavioral disorder </i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>26</i></sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> relating to abnormal brain firing 
and a cluster of episodic symptoms<i>, paroxysmal somatoform disorder</i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>27</i></sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i> </i>
relating to a cluster of episodic non-epileptic bodily symptoms and<i> 
paroxysmal photosensitivity syndrome</i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>28</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> relating to profound sensitivity to 
flashing lights producing a cluster of episodic symptoms ranging from 
headache to seizures to vertigo to nausea. These are very appropriate 
combination terms because they describe new medical conditions made 
up of a cluster of symptoms, signs and tests. They therefore fulfill 
a void in the literature, and reflect new simple, parsimonious contributions 
to the medical literature. </font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I 
have further previously described another but different kind of neuropsychiatric 
medical entity, namely dysproccia</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>29</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. This differs in that it reflects 
a <i>syndrome</i>—this reflects a cluster of symptom features that 
empirically manifest based on the higher brain dysfunction difficulty 
of processing information. Like many neurological conditions, there 
can be a motor, sensory or mixed component. Hence amongst the subterms 
for this neologism are other neologism phrases. Namely e<i>xecutive 
dysproccia, perceptual dysproccia </i>
and <i>mixed dysproccia</i>, respectively. Again, there was a need for 
the condition, because children particularly commonly have learning 
disabilities as a consequence (they take hours to do 20 minutes of homework, 
for example) and a demand for a descriptive term, because this was lacking.</font></p>
 <br>
<p>      <font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>New 
medical concepts</b></font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One 
of the most famous of our more recent neurological concepts was the 
awareness that repetitive stimulation of an area of the brain could 
result in the stimulus required being less to evoke a response. Canadian, 
Graham Goddard in 1967 called this <i>kindling</i>— just as a small 
spark applied to tinder can ignite a flame that eventually can grow 
into a roaring bonfire, a small electrical stimulus, just large enough 
to trigger a brief burst of seizure activity, when repeatedly applied, 
may eventually generate seizures that can lead to fully generalized 
behavioral convulsions. The evolution of the neologism was my own further 
extension of this concept to <i>chindling. </i>
Effectively, chindling is chemically (as opposed to electrically) induced 
kindling like phenomenon e.g., with lidocaine, where tiny doses eventually 
produce a threshold response.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>30</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> The phenomenon although akin to kindling 
is pharmacologically different. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In a similar vein, one can 
analyze symptoms and develop clusters of terms based on the symptom 
relevance and specificity to various anatomical areas. Here an important 
brain example relates to two measuring historical questionnaires I developed 
(TLQ, INSET) screening for temporal lobe disease or dysfunction in the 
brain</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>31</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
with the terms PTLSs (possible temporal lobe symptoms), as well as others 
e.g., CTLSs (controversial temporal lobe symptoms) plus non-specific 
(temporal lobe) symptoms. Again the purpose has to be to enhance scientific 
classification which it does.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
final medical examples reflect pharmacological concepts: when enzymes 
in the liver are speeded up, we refer to induction of these enzymes. 
This was described by several authors about 1961.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now the interesting aspect 
is that I described the opposite phenomenon of <i>deinduction </i>
(using the carbamazepine model) about 1986. Several experts have thought 
I developed this term. While researching this article, I discovered 
that indeed it was Albers in 1963 that had first used the term induction! </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>32</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
(Although this was not a clinical description). </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A 
final example of a neologism in pharmacology is describing a <i>new 
side-effect</i>. If there is no verbalization of its exact nature it 
goes unrecognized. I first used the term <i>“NVD” </i>
or <i>“Non-vertiginous dizziness”</i> in 1989 to reflect a common 
side-effect specific to some azapirone drugs such as buspirone. Such 
descriptions are best based physiologically and this seems correlated 
with the serotonin 1A receptor subtype.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>33</sup></font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then 
there is the need for extending the <i>classification </i>
of common medical events. We would always talk of “minor brain injury” 
when referring to concussions or short periods of unconsciousness after 
head injury. But there is nothing minor about someone who may end up 
with possible permanent sequelae, sometimes due to a specific area of 
higher brain cortex being damaged. It was important to recognize that 
all we were measuring was degree of closed head injury, consequently 
in 1999, I introduced the terms <i>closed head injury of transient—CHIT 
(and permanent—CHIP) types.</i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>34</i></sup></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
common key to all of these is that unless we know about the presence 
of some medical feature and have a way to describe it, it will not be 
recognized. Language is our key vehicle to achieve this. </font></p>

 <br>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Déjà 
vu experiences</i> could illustrate neologisms for three reasons: First, 
it is, par excellence, the new term that has derived from another language 
(here French) and accepted into our English lexicography; secondly, 
there have been numerous new terms introduced over the past three decades—in 
fact, I don’t know of any other area in which there are so many derivative 
English terms; and thirdly, in the context of my own personal explorations,<i> 
déjà experiences</i> have dramatically reflected my work in neologisms.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In 
my 1983 book on the topic, the first scientific one in the literature, <i>
The Psychology of Déjà Vu: Have I Been Here Before,</i> </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>36</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
I defined <i>déjà vu</i> (literally “already seen” and regarded 
as the generic <i>déjà</i> experience) with a definition that is now 
universally used namely <i>“any subjectively inappropriate impression 
of familiarity of the present experience with an undefined past</i><b><i>.</i></b><i>” </i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>37</sup></font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Could 
we shelter all the different forms under that single umbrella term of<i> 
déjà vu</i>? It appeared not, as by the time of my research in 1979, 
there were already ten other lesser known <i>déjà </i>
terms, all decades old: Some, such as <i>déjà 
voulu, </i>were purely theoretical, with active reports being unavailable.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In 
my 1981 PhD thesis, I needed to suggest ten new kinds of<i> déjà 
experiences</i> (see <i>“Déjà Vu Revisited”</i><b>) </b>

plus four new déjà subtypes. In 2006, I <a name="0.1.1_OLE_LINK56"></a><a name="0.1.1_OLE_LINK57"></a>
updated the literature (“<i>Déjà 
vu: A Second Look”</i><b>)</b> describing nine new déjà experiences, 
and creating a third glossary and bibliography in the area (“<i>Déjà 
vu: Glossary and Library”)</i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>38</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This 
way when <i>déjà vu</i> is screened for, these potentially new kinds 
of <i>déjà </i>experiences are asked about. Otherwise we may remain 
unaware of their presence particularly in patients with psychosis, temporal 
lobe disease and in <i>subjective paranormal experients</i>. Indeed, 
they became part of the most comprehensive questionnaire on the topic.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>39</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
demonstration of different subtypes of déjà experience justifies 
all these different new terms as scientists can now approach this phenomenon 
more completely.</font></p>

Psychopathological Perspective to Neologisms (Part 5).</i></b></font><font size="5" face="Times"><sup><b>40</b></sup></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>“Neologisms 
tend not only to hypostatize themselves to an amazing degree, but actually 
to replace the reality they were originally intended to express.” 
—</i>Carl Gustav Jung </font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>41</sup></font></p>
 <br>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What 
is not meaningful should not be new or accepted: It becomes idiosyncratic 
and possibly psychiatric<i>.</i> As a neuropsychiatrist and also as 
a phenomenologist I am ambivalent about the uninhibited, “normal” 
use of the term “neologism” (above): My training has always perceived 
neologisms as specifically limited to abnormality, implying unique, 
unnecessary, unparsimonious complexity.</font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In 
psychiatry, the term <i>neologism</i> has a special use, possibly since 
its first use by Schreber in 1858.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>42</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> It is expressly used to describe individuals, 
generally psychotic patients, who develop their own new language system 
including new words. These reflect pathological symptoms with idiosyncratic 
or meaningless relevance. Sometimes they are so bizarre that they may 
reflect a “word salad” with incomprehensible sounds put together. 
Psychiatric neologisms are words or phrases that only have meaning to 
the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. This 
is usually considered normal in children (although it may occur pathologically 
as in autism), but a symptom of thought disorder (indicative of a psychotic 
mental illness, such as schizophrenia) in adults. Neurologically, neologisms 
may also be related to aphasia acquired after brain damage, resulting 
for example, from a stroke or head injury, or infection of the brain. 
Aphasia is the term applied for a disorder of higher brain functioning 
in relation to the content of speech. Neologisms may sometimes be close 
approximations to words and phrases, where the patient is seeking out 
a word that they cannot fully verbalize. On the other hand, in psychosis, 
the neologism may be so unusual that there is not even any resemblance 
to any known concept and it may be based on special meanings the patient 
imputes to objects or events.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
is incidentally even a theological use of neologism: This is a relatively 
new doctrine (for example, rationalism) where the neologist is an innovator 
in the area of a doctrine or belief system. Although, this is often 
considered heretical or subversive by the mainstream clergy or religious 
institution, it certainly is not pathological. This is an example of 
distinguishing ideas that are idiosyncratic and are individual, fixed 
and false (delusions) from those that may be false and strange but relating 
to subculture. Delusions may characteristically respond to appropriate 
psychopharmacological interventions. The exact nature and dosage are 
dependent on the underlying electrical-chemical disturbances.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>43</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
In contrast, beliefs that do not pervade the broader macroculture but 
may fit the family or microsociety will not respond to antipsychotic 
medication—generally, such persons would not tolerate a half or even 
a tenth of the dose that an acutely psychotic patient would. Becoming, 
for example, severely sedated or developing muscle stiffness. This is, 
in fact, one test of another medical neological diagnostic entity I 
described (1984) namely <i>Subjective paranormal experience psychosis</i></font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup><i>44</i></sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i> </i>

that entered the mainstream psychiatric literature in 1989.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>45</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
(The term <i>subjective paranormal experience</i> or <i>SPE</i> is also 
a neologism approaching its third decade in the parapsychological literature.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>46</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">)</font></p>
 <br>
<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Final 
Remarks</i></b></font></p>

 <br>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I, 
clearly, have a fascination with words, particularly new words. But 
those neologisms must have a utility and be a contribution to the area. 
My favorite personal neologism remains <i>sciction</i> (1999)</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>47</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
to describe a new literary genre requiring science through literature, 
and fascination through education and its differentiation of previous 
related but different words such as <i>science-fiction</i> and <i>faction</i>. 
With <i>sciction </i>came the awareness of a new writing style, creating 
the combination subparagraphs that I called <i>conversagraphs</i>.</font><font size="3" face="Times"><sup>48</sup></font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I 
regard the lexicographer’s awarenesses in neologisms research as requiring: </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Documentation of new terms 
that are used in the relevant literature if they give any hint of being 
used by others; and setting forth terms that should be used more frequently 
than they are. Specifically:</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Certainly, new 
  words and phrases should evolve to meaningful concepts. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Neologisms will 
  continue to occur more often in rapidly changing cultures and also in 
  situations where there is easy and fast propagation of information, 
  such as new sciences.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">New terms are often 
  created by special circumstances, combining existing words or phrases 
  or through abbreviation or acronym, by intentionally rhyming with existing 
  words or simply through playing with sounds. Today, they can often become 
  more popular through <i>memetics</i>—the mass media, Internet, academic 
  discourse and advertising (e.g., <i>McDonaldization</i>). </font></li>

</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We should bear in mind that 
every word was in the beginning a neologism, requiring continued acceptance 
for its continued use and possible public modifications over time. This 
is the evolution of the neologism!</font></p>
