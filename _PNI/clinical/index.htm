                        <P> The focus of the Pacific Neuropsychiatric Institute 
                          is <I>mostly <A
HREF="../disclaimer.html">face-to-face</A> clinical consultations</I> for patients 
                          with neuropsychiatric and psychopharmacologic difficulties. 
                          This includes disease processes with <I>behavioral or 
                          psychological difficulties</I> associated with known 
                          or suspected <I>neurological</I> conditions such as 
                          epilepsy, head injury, attention deficit disorder, dementia, 
                          tardive dyskinesia, atypical spells, irritability and 
                          any organic mental disorder. We also evaluate difficult 
                          to treat <I>psychological or psychiatric conditions</I>, 
                          including problems relating to <I>medication. Unfortunately, 
                          the PNI cannot do any specific consultations over the 
                          World Wide Web and any emails or other communications 
                          in that regard will necessarily not be answered</I>. 
                        </P>
                        <P> The evaluation goal is to provide a blueprint not 
                          only for the present but directions for the patient's 
                          primary physician (generally necessary) to manage the 
                          patient in the future. </P>

                          evaluates all new patient referrals necessarily over 
                          several <I>consultations</I>. (Generally 4 to 5 plus 
                          extensive testing).

                          such as <I>non-responsive psychosis</I>, depression 
                          and panic, including problems relating to <I>medication</I>.

                        <P> Patients are generally referred from other physicians 
                          or other health care professionals for a neuropsychiatric 
                          and/or psychopharmacologic evaluation. They are then 
                          referred back to their original referring physicians 
                          when appropriate. Referrals to follow-up physicians 
                          may occur after weeks or months depending on circumstances. 
                          For example, the referring doctor may wish to separate 
                          pharmacologic from psychotherapy management, or just 
                          be requesting a second opinion, or may want a guide 
                          to the pharmacologic or neuropsychiatric elements, or 
                          sometimes the patient prefers not to consult with their 
                          previous physician. Optimally, we want to work with 
                          the referring doctor or therapist. </P>

                        <P> The major approach is towards pharmacologic management 
                          of the pathophysiologic difficulties (not psychotherapy) 
                          although the PNI tries to be very aware of the relevance 
                          of the biopsychofamiliosociocultural perspective. Patients 
                          generally complete detailed questionnaires on computers 
                          or paper, plus tests given face to face and other tests 
                          like EEGs, ambulatory EEGs, MRIs or blood tests as deemed 
                          necessary with their assessment. The tests generally 
                          take two or three half day sessions. They may involve 
                          psychosocial screening, personality, behavioral and 
                          psychodiagnostic evaluations, special evaluations of 
                          areas of the brain such as the temporal lobe or for 
                          specific neuropsychiatric abilities and deficits. The 
                          evaluation goal is to provide a blueprint not only for 
                          the present but directions for the patient?s primary 
                          physician (generally necessary) to manage the patient 
                          in the future. Referrals to follow-up physicians may 
                          occur after weeks or longer depending on circumstances.
