<ul>

<li>This is a sample web page to test the settings for your FormMail script.

<li>The script uses /usr/lib/sendmail, a free e-mail program installed on our servers.

<li>The form below WILL work if you correctly answered the questions on your administration page.

<li>The script is a modification of FORMMAIL by Mathew Wright, a free program.

<li>If you want additional features, or have trouble with options you may want to go to
his free script site <a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">here.</a>

<li>We DO NOT PROVIDE FREE SUPPORT explaining how to install scripts, you may want to consult
a book on Perl, CGI, or ISAPI applications.

<li>This working sample is meant to help you create working forms.

<li>VERSION 1.6 of FormMail has been installed into your cgi-bin directory.

<li></a><font FACE="Arial"> The complete readme with all the options allowed is listed
below and can also be found of <a href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/">Matt's
site.</a></font>

</ul>

<p align="center"><font SIZE="-2" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FF0000">Formmail is setup and ready
to use.&nbsp; Many additional features are built-in, read the samples below.
&nbsp; HOWEVER, once you have modified the script for these additional features Interland
will not support it.&nbsp; IF you correctly use the options they will work.</font> </p>

<p align="center">If you view the source of this HTML file you will see the recipient tag,
is a hidden tag, it is set to the e-mail address you entered in the administration page.
&nbsp; If you delete this then the formmail program will not know where to send the e-mail.</p>

<em>Can I have multiple recipients?</em><br>
<br>
Short Answer:<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Long Answer:<br>
<br>
Yes, all you have to do is put multiple e-mail addresses in the recipient field of your
form,<br>
separated by commas. <br>
<br>
&lt;input type=hidden name=&quot;recipient&quot;<br>
value=&quot;email1@address1.com,email2@address2.net&quot;&gt;</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FormMail is a universal WWW form to E-mail gateway. There is only one required form
      input tag which must be specified in order for this script to work with your existing
      forms. Other hidden configuration fields can also be used to enhance the operation of
      FormMail on your site. Version 1.6 of FormMail contains a few minor bug fixes, optimized
      code and more comments. The biggest change in this version is that by default, form fields
      are now sorted as they appear in the form. Error pages were also beautified a little and
      two new configuration fields were created. Read the History for a more complete list of
      changes.</p>
      <p>The script, FormMail.pl, needs to be placed in your server's cgi-bin and the anonymous
      WWW user must have the ability to read/execute the script. If you do not have access to
      your server's cgi-bin, yet you can execute cgi scripts, you may want to try adding a .cgi
      extension to the FormMail.pl, so you could move it to FormMail.cgi.</p>

    <ul>
      <p>The FormMail.pl script does not have to be extensively configured in order to work.
      There are only two variables in the perl file which you will need to define along with
      changing the top line of your script to match the location of you Perl interpreter.</p>
      <a name="necessary_vars"><h3><u>Necessary Variables</u></h3>
      </a><blockquote>
        <dl>
          <dt><a name="mailprog"><b><tt>$mailprog = '/usr/lib/sendmail';</tt></b></a> </dt>
          <dd>This variable must define the location to your server's sendmail program. If this is
            incorrect, form results will not be mailed to you.</dd>
          <dt><a name="referers"><b><tt>@referers = ('worldwidemart.com','206.31.72.203');</tt></b></a>
          </dt>
          <dd>This array allows you to define the domains that you will allow forms to reside on and
            use your FormMail script. If a user tries to put a form on another server, that is not
            worldwidemart.com, they will receive an error message when someone tries to fill out their
            form. By placing worldwidemart.com in the @referers array, this also allows
            www.worldwidemart.com, ftp.worldwidemart.com, any other http address with
            worldwidemart.com in it and worldwidemart.com's IP address to access this script as well,
            so no users will be turned away. </dd>

      <p>The action of your form needs to point towards this script (obviously), and the method
      must be POST or GET in capital letters. Version 1.5 of FormMail offers many new ways to
      code your form to tailor the resulting HTML page and the way the script performs. Below is
      a list of form fields you can use and how to implement them.</p>

            <td>Allows you to have Environment variables included in the e-mail message you receive
            after a user has filled out your form. Useful if you wish to know what browser they were
            using, what domain they were coming from or any other attributes associated with
            environment variables. The following is a short list of valid environment variables that
            might be useful:<pre>

REMOTE_HOST     - Sends the hostname making the 
                  request.
REMOTE_ADDR     - Sends the IP address of the
                  remote host making the request.
REMOTE_USER     - If server supports authentication
                  and script is protected, this is
                  the username they have
                  authenticated as. *This is not
                  usually set.*
HTTP_USER_AGENT - The browser the client is using
                  to send the request.</pre>
            <p>There are others, but these are a few of the most useful. For more information on
            environment variables, see:</p>

            alphabetically or specify a set order in which you want the fields to appear in your mail
            message. By leaving this field out, the order will simply default to the order in which
            the browsers sends the information to the script (which is usually the exact same order as
            they appeared in the form.) When sorting by a set order of fields, you should include the
            phrase &quot;order:&quot; as the first part of your value for the sort field, and then
            follow that with the field names you want to be listed in the e-mail message, separated by
            commas. Version 1.6 allows a little more flexibility in the listing of ordered fields, in
            that you can include spaces and line breaks in the field without it messing up the sort.
            This is helpful when you have many form fields and need to insert a line wrap.<br>

                        uid was disabled, thanks to Paul Phillips

                        realname, etc... the script will not 
                        print these fields to either your mail 
                        message or to the user's screen when they
                        are returned to a generic form response.
                        It helps you so that things do not get
                        duplicated.
Version 1.3 01/21/96 -  Much needed update finally completed
                     -  Added form fields: env_report, bgcolor, 
                        background, link_color, vlink_color,
                        title, text_color, return_link_title, 
                        return_link_title, and required.
                     -  Security hole, which allowed any user on 
                        any system to bum off of your formmail
                        script, has been plugged up with the
                        @referers variable.
                     -  Report style in return html and e-mail 
                        touched up a bit.
Version 1.4 01/23/96 -  Added options: sort, alink_color
                     -  Fixed a few bugs from Version 1.3, namely
                        the fact that the link_colors weren't
                        working well.
                     -  FormMail now supports both the GET and
                        POST methods.
Version 1.5 02/05/96 -  Sorting of Fields in E-Mail Response
                        Fixed.
                     -  print_config option added.
Version 1.6 05/02/97 -  Sorting of fields by default was fixed to
                        now sort in the order the fields are
                        passed to FormMail from the web browser,
                        which is usually the same order as they
                        appear in the HTML form.
                     -  The sort order: directive, env_report and 
                        print_config parsing routines were made
                        to better compensate for line breaks and
                        extra spaces in input for ease of use.
                     -  Redirect error causing the redirect
                        option to incorrectly work with https
                        (secure servers) was fixed.
                     -  Output of non-filled in form fields
                        suppressed.
                     -  E-mail addresses checked for correct
                        syntax if designated a required field.
                     -  Fields only printed if they contain a
                        value or if the print_blank_fields option
                        is set to 1.
                     -  missing_fields_redirect added so you can
                        route users who don't completely fill out
                        the form to a pre-made HTML page.
                     -  Parts of code optimized, especially in
                        respect to the way config variables are
                        handled.
