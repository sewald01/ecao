<H1 align="center" CLASS="title">Style of Sciction: Prologue</H1>

<br><br>

<P>While writing this book, I was faced with a dilemma. How do
I convey important scientific information on psychiatry, neurology,
social issues and medications in a vivid and readable fashion?
Science, at times, is too detailed and dry; and case histories
plus factual information do not easily fit the fabric of a novel.</P>

<P>The solution was <I>sciction</I> -- science through literature
(or based on its name but less precisely&nbsp; because sciction
is classified as non-fiction, science through fiction).</P>

<P>Sciction (pronounced &quot;skikshun&quot;) reflects the literary
vehicle for the voyage of exploration that is this book: I apply
the methods of medical diagnosis and treatment to the cases, but
the patients they represent are fictitious amalgams. I have melded
concepts with composite patients to portray my approach to helping
another's suffering. The object is an education far more diverse
than the management of the actual patient. The <I>end</I> is greater
understanding of numerous different psychiatric and pharmacological
areas; the <I>means</I> is the composite illustrative patient.</P>

<P>Sciction allows for a special style-a play embedded in prose-to
facilitate comprehension and enjoyment. The teaching model of
doctor and student is woven into the dialogue of the book, just
as the treating model of doctor and patient is. These interactions
represent a well-established interactional teaching style. However,
the added prose amplifies, links, clarifies and narrates compassionate
care.</P>

<P>Sciction necessitates three diverse didactic leaps: Firstly,
providing helpful information sometimes necessitates actually
detailing doses; this may compromise the literary flow, but helps
to remind us that specific dosing is critical for success. Secondly,
the medical student, Andrew, through his questions and especially
through the responses of the Doctor, becomes a particularly convenient
educational device to convey relevant information; but of course,
in reality, almost all these interactions with patients are performed
in the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship, and
not with a student present. Thirdly, a large letter beginning
a paragraph separates significant theme changes. This commonly
reflects time-shifts or changes in the discussion. Signifying
these separations creates more intelligible portions for the reader
to digest; it also allows for targeting significant interest areas
more easily. This balance of detailed complex pharmacology and
intelligible simplification is a delicate one: Particularly complex
themes or pharmacological detail are, in addition, punctuated
by an explanatory footnote linked with the large letter beginning
and ending the section. This way, the reader is alerted to what
can be skimmed over. These techniques allow more comfortable reading:
Appropriate comfort level is a priority for education and fascination.</P>

<P>Stylistically, maximizing education without sacrificing clarity
proved a challenge solved by a series of global structural changes
aimed at greater ease of reading: The dialogue style of italics
for questions and regular print for answers enables you to more
easily scan for specific interest areas. I have found the &quot;em
dash&quot; (written &quot;--&quot;) a valuable way to define medical
phrases succinctly. Other techniques are also aimed at easier
comprehension: Every chapter begins with a &quot;Key Chapter Themes&quot;
summary. Furthermore, I encourage you to make use of a series
of reference glossaries at the back of the book. These clarify
concepts and terms. They include a brief brain diagram, drug categories,
lists of neurotransmitters, definitions of medical terms, specifics
on the pier and bathtub analogies in the book, medical abbreviations,
generic and trade names, indexes and endnotes. By these means,
difficult concepts become more comprehensible to the curious layperson.</P>

<P>Sciction produces its own dilemmas. As a scientist, I wanted
to document every comment with a reference. I fought off that
temptation to make this book more readable to the lay person.
I have generally found it inappropriate to cite the text, as the
cases themselves are scictitious-scientific fictional composites.
I have restricted citation to a minimum, in endnotes at the back
of the book, identifying only the essentials of the concept under
discussion or sources for amplification. Sometimes these endnotes
reference my work in order to share the personal and professional
voyage of discovery that is the overall thrust of this book. This
allows you to resonate a little with the historical perspective.
Such citations are not meant to diminish the important contributions
of uncited colleagues.</P>

<P>The sciction style of this book allows for two interwoven elements:
The unique case histories in this book fascinate, the themes in
the chapters educate. However, the factual areas dealt with may
reflect exceptions, not the rule. Simplification may compromise
extremely complex subjects and there is a danger of loss of perspective
if specific patient experiences are too easily generalized. Most
patients do not require extreme measures to improve; most physician
consults yield beneficial results; and critiques of particular
drugs do not imply the medications are deficient, just unsuitable
for the portrayed scictitious patient. Individual bad reactions
do not make medications globally inappropriate. Pharmacological
interventions generally involve the subtle balance of beneficial
effects far outweighing side effects; and profound adverse reactions
are relatively rare in practice. &quot;When you hear the hoof
beats you should think of horses not zebras.&quot;&nbsp;<span class=booktitle>Cry
the Beloved Mind</span> portrays the exotic mysteries of zebras,
even as it teaches the general principles of horses.</P>
