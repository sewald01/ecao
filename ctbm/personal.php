      <br><br>

      <P>The <a class="std" href="/ctbm/autographed.php">autographed first edition</a> will contain an original
      signature by the author, Dr Vernon Neppe, on the title page.
      You may want to ask Dr Neppe to personally inscribe the book. For a small additional fee&nbsp;</P>

      <P><B><a name="customized">Customized Copies</a></B>:<br> 
      For a limited time only, and an extra $2.50 per book, your signed autographed copy may be personally
      inscribed by Dr Neppe to you or you and your friend. Dr Neppe
      will also write a short personal message (one of &quot;Enjoy.&quot;,
      &quot;With best wishes.&quot;, or &quot;Good luck.&quot;&nbsp;)
      If you order multiple books and want different inscriptions on each book, 
      please note this in the comments section.</P>

      <P><B><a name="personalized">Personalized Copies</a></b>:<br>
      Personalized inscriptions may be possible beyond two people or three words. This costs $5 instead
      of the $2.50 extra. There is space on the order form to specify the inscription. Again, if you
      order more than one book and want a different inscription on each book, please note that clearly
      in the comments, along with the inscriptions you would like.</P>

      <P><b><A class="std" name="millennial" HREF="/ctbm/millennial.php">Millennial Collectors Editions</a></b>: <BR>
      The Millennial Edition is $25 extra for those numbered between 20 and 99, $50 extra for those between 10-19, and
      $100 extra for those between 1 and 9, per book. 
      If these numbers are unavailable in the quantities you request we will contact you to discuss alternatives. 
      Whereas the Millennial Edition is speculative, it may be an excellent long-term investment but
      no warranties or guarantees can be given.<BR>
      There are good reasons why this millennial version could inflate in value:<BR>
      1. This is the first book written in the new literary genre of sciction.<BR>
      2. Collector's numbered autographed first edition.<BR>
      3. This book may become a classic.</P>

      <P>Collectors will want this book. Cover it in transparent plastic
      or similar material so it can maintain its original appearance.</P>
