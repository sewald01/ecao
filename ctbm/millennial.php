<h1 class="title" align="center">Special Millennial Edition</h1>

<br><b>Autographed copies:</b><br>

<P>You cannot obtain an autographed copy
from any other source unless you are lucky enough to meet with
Dr Neppe. <br />Although this cannot be guaranteed, it is usual that
autographed versions can become significantly more valuable as
collector's items. <br />Numerous determining factors are involved but
this being a first edition could make it more so. Even more so,
you may even be able to obtain a personalized, customized or millennial
edition copy. See below for more details. As is the custom in
the book industry, there are no returns once the author has signed
a copy.</P>
<br /><b>Why go to the extra expense of a millennial edition?</b>
<P>Clearly the Millennial Edition version is for a unique occasion.
<br />If the book becomes more valuable, this is the logical edition to use.
<br />The Millennial Book has already increased in value.</p>
<BR>

<h2 class="title">Millennial Collection Editions</h2>

<br>

<P>First only for collectors, the <B>Millennial
Collector's Edition</B> of Cry the Beloved Mind, Millennial.  This is the same book. However, it is a potentially valuable collector's item. 
<br />The wording is special and includes the words "Special Millennium Edition" and dated 1/1/2000. and signed by Vernon Neppe, the author.  It does not address anyone specifically, unless you request it (same price) (e.g. "To Tom Smith") (This would be written at the time of order and is on a separate page).
</P>

<p>There are 100 Collector's editions books. Each now has a special seal on indicating its numbering but also is numbered on the page.
Copies 1 through 10 come with a special certificate as well.
We strongly suggest you purchase a Millennial edition which you treat carefully, and a second one to read.
</p>
<p>COSTS: if there are special reduction offers this applies.

<P><b>WHY ORDER A MILLENIAL EDITION?</b><br />
Whereas no warranties or guarantees can be given, there is good
reason why this millennial version could inflate in value.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. This is the first book written in
  the new literary genre of sciction.  This makes the book unique.</P>
  <P>2. A  MILLENNIAL EDITION happens once in a lifetime (millennium actually!) and may be an excellent long-term investment.</P>
  <P>3. A numbered autographed first edition
  makes this a collector's item. Only 100 are available. The lower numbers should increase its value further.</P>
  <P>4. This book has been very well received
  and may become a classic.</P>
  <P>Collectors will want this book.</P>

<b>OTHER VERSIONS</b>
<br>
<P><h3 class="title">PERSONALIZED AND CUSTOMIZED
VERSIONS</h3><BR>
THERE ARE FOUR LEVELS OF AUTOGRAPH
FROM THE AUTHOR.</P>

<P>1. The first -- above-- is the <B>MILLENIAL
EDITION.</B><BR>
2. Second are straight <B>AUTOGRAPHED</B> copies: The author's
signature alone appears on the title page and this is not an extra
price <BR>
3. Third, the title page can be <B>CUSTOMIZED</B>. e.g. &quot;To
Jack and Jill, With best wishes. (signature)&quot; Choice of phrases:
&quot;With best wishes.&quot; &quot;Enjoy!&quot; &quot;Good luck.&quot;
This is $2.50 extra. <BR>
4. Fourth, the Rolls Royce, is <B>PERSONALIZED</B>. Personalized
inscription is involved if there are more than two names or more
than three words in the inscription. It is $5 extra provided not
more than a total of ten words (excluding the To Jack and Jill
line, signature and date) and $0.50 per word extra beyond twelve.
You can suggest exact wording but <I>no guarantees can be made
and Dr Neppe's decision is final</I> in that regard. An example
would be &nbsp;&quot;To Jack , Jill and Peter. With my very best
wishes. Good luck to you all. Vernon M Neppe. 2/1/2000.&quot;
<BR>
</P>

<P><div class="bigger">PLEASE MAKE SURE WE GET IT
RIGHT. FILL IN UNDER COMMENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORDER FORM.</div>
<BR>
Brainvoyage.com has developed an order form which will include
all these variations. YOU MUST MENTION THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE
YOU WANT DR NEPPE TO ADDRESS IF YOU ORDER PERSONALIZED, CUSTOMIZED
OR MILLENIAL COPIES. E.G. To Jack and Jill. IF YOU DON'T, WE CANNOT
ADDRESS ANYONE.<BR>
<BR>
When you complete the order form, you may check &quot;Personalized&quot;
(which will mean Dr Neppe will personalize for $2.50 more; if
you prefer wording indicate e.g. &quot;To Jack and Jill. With
best wishes.&quot; If no wording: Dr Neppe chooses.<BR>
If you check &quot;Customized&quot; (with your words of customization)
e.g. &quot;To Linda, Jeff and Veronica, This book is important
to me.&quot; If no wording, Dr Neppe will choose.<BR>
If you check, &quot;Millennial&quot; (Here the words are not customized
as there is a fixed script) but you can choose whether you want
&quot;To Linda, Jeff and Veronica&quot; or no address (default). For millennial editions only, if you want
the book addressed to a person or people, please note it and give the address in the comments section.
