<h1 align="center" class="title"> Downloadable Electronic Version Now PDF, EPUB, MOBI</h1>

<p>Cry the Beloved Mind apparently made history as the first Electronic Book (E-book) to be sold commercially. A company called Digital River (DigitalRiver.com) marketed it and it did not do well electronically because it was too far ahead of its time. However, that made it into a likely valuable collector's item.</p>

<p>Now many years later, recognizing that E-books are often in E-Pub format, we have introduced an E-Pub and MOBI version. These are done as a service at no extra charge to the previous PDF that only existed and we can make no guarantees about their quality on your device.</p>

<font size=+2>Why an internet downloaded
version?</font></h1>

<b>ADVANTAGES</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li> <b>Saves costs</b> compared with
other versions.
<li> <b>Immediate availability.</b> This is particularly relevant if you
are downloading from outside the USA where mail of a CD-ROM or the book
itself could be slow.
<br>Even if youíre in Timbuktu you can purchase through the internet.
<li> <b>PDF files allow searching</b> for information using Adobe Acrobat
Reader.
<br>(Note: given the nature of the Adobe Acrobat, not all specific keywords
will necessarily be located on a search. We have found the search tool
valuable.)
<li> The capability of; <b>entering</b> <b>specific pages</b> and
move immediately to them, as well as the capacity to print the material
makes this electronic version even more versatile.
<br>(Of course, you cannot redistribute any information without our written
consent that you have printed and it is, of course, prohibited to modify
the contents of this book.)
<li> <b>PC or Macintosh</b>. PDF files like these have become the
standard way of communicating information. Their great advantage is they
are cross-platform. This means if you have a PC for example with windows, you can read
the book. If you have a macintosh, you can read the book. PDF files even can
be read on UNIX computers. Moreover, PDF files are read with a free reader called Adobe Acrobat
Reader and this is freely available for download. Please refer to the <a class="std" href="/order/faq.php">FAQ</a>
for more details. 
<li> <b>Combination bound and electronic copy reduced in price</b>. We
have ensured that the page numbers stayed the same as the hard copy of
the book.
<br>This means you can read the bound copy of the book and reference through
the digital version.
<br>To ensure that you obtain a bargain in this regard, we have reduced
the price for the combination by $5.
<br>For those of you who want to regard this as a serious reference text,
we recommend the combination.
<li> <b>Reference work</b>. Possibly most important, is you can use this
electronic book as an excellent reference work.
<br>We have gone to special trouble to ensure that this is so. WE EVEN
HAVE CREATED A DUPLICATE GLOSSARY SERIES FOR YOU.
<br>This means that you can have the PDF file open in the book, and the
Glossary open as well so you can use the Glossary for direct reference.
</ul>

<b>Refund policy</b>
<blockquote>
Liability: This is limited to the cost of the purchase less processing
fees. Please remember this file is > 2 megabytes.
You should consider downloading it if you have a fast modem connection
(e.g. 28.8 kilobaud or more) and
your internet service provider will not disconnect even if the file
takes time to download.
(Depending on the modem, server and the internet it could be much faster
but sometimes 2 or 3 megabytes take up to 40 minutes)
If you have a slower modem and prefer receiving a CD ROM Disk via mail,
this option will be available, we hope, at a later date.
