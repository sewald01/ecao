<DL>
  <DT class="emphasis">Self-help resource:
  <DD>Cry the Beloved Mind is an <EM>important self-help resource</EM>
  relating <EM>brain medications</EM> to such conditions as <EM>depression,
  seizures, psychosis and unusual episodes</EM>. These conditions
  possibly impact on at least <EM>half the Americ an population</EM>
  (as patients or family members or friends.)
  <DT class="emphasis">Broad emphasis:
  <DD>The <EM>broad emphasis</EM> allows for a perspective not
  generally encountered in books on narrower topics like depression
  alone. It also covers a range of areas in psychiatry and neurology
  like movement disorders and difficult to diagnose symptom cl
  usters. It also discusses <EM>drug interactions</EM> and even
  <EM>herbal treatments</EM>.
  <DT class="emphasis">Sciction:
  <DD>It is written in a new literary style, sciction-science through
  fiction based on composite factual patients. The special style
  involves a play within prose.
  <DT class="emphasis">Authority:
  <DD>The author, Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD, is an <EM>international
  authority</EM> in several areas of the main topic of this book:
  brain medications.
  <DT class="emphasis">Education through fascination:
  <DD>The book is far more than a self-help resource. The case
  histories are made to <EM>fascinate</EM> and the diagnostic issues
  make it a detective type of medical fiction. In this way it is
  comparable to the writings of the neuropsychiatrist author, <EM>Oliver
  Sacks</EM> in that it aims at <EM>education</EM>.
  <DT class="emphasis">Providing hope:
  <DD>The common theme of each chapter is that even the most difficult
  of cases can realistically sometimes be helped given detailed
  medical, neurological, psychiatric and psychological evaluations
  over time; how much more so with conditions that are easier to
  treat?
  <DT class="emphasis">Pivotal discoveries:
  <DD>Dr. Neppe describes his own <EM>pivotal discoveries</EM>
  which change practice in the area, and allows insights into these
  special <EM>voyages of exploration</EM>.
  <DT class="emphasis">Readability:
  <DD>The author has targeted the book for the curious general
  reader to understand. The patient can almost experience consulting
  with Dr. Neppe.
  <DT class="emphasis">Reference resource:
  <DD><EM>Extensive glossaries</EM> make it a valuable reference
  resource for the general reader.
  <DT class="emphasis">Spice of social medical dilemmas:
  <DD>The book reflects important <EM>social medical dilemmas</EM>.
  The author enlightens us on aspects like informed consent, generic
  substitution, herbal remedies and principles of drug interactions;
  he allows personal insights into gun control, suicide,emotional
  growth and normality. This forms a <EM>vital spice</EM> of the
  book and makes it exude hope, help and respect.
  <DT class="emphasis">Previous books:
  <DD>Dr. Neppe is well-published in the journal literature. Dr.
  Neppe also has written two previous books for colleagues. His
  venture to the broader public was punctuated by vast lecturing
  experience.
  <DT class="emphasis">First in the series:
  <DD>Cry the Beloved Mind should be the first in a series of Cry
  the Beloved books on the brain and dilemmas, all sciction, and
  all aimed at education through fascination with social dilemmas
  as spice.
  <DT class="emphasis">Unique:
  <DD>Unique features include sciction, pivotal discoveries, play
  within prose, self help through education by fascination, the
  reader experiencing the doctor's consulting room and interacting
  with an expert at work.
  <DT class="emphasis">Immediate appeal:
  <DD>The title and front and back covers should immediately attract
  readers.
  <DT class="emphasis">Competitively priced:
  <DD>Cry the Beloved Mind doubles up as a self-help book as well
  as an educational text, besides representing a new style genre.
  As a text it is a bargain, <EM>as a voyage of hope it is very
  worthwhile</EM>.
  <DT class="emphasis">Broad Readership:
  <DD>This book is clearly logical for purchase nationally and
  round the world.
  <DT class="emphasis">Also for students and colleagues:
  <DD>The book has even greater utility than patients, families
  of patients and the general reader. It has the potential market
  of undergraduate students in psychology, sociology, nursing and
  literature. It makes for an easy way to understand difficult
  concepts. Post-graduates students and colleagues in medicine,
  psychiatry, neurology. psychology and pharmacy should also benefit.
  <DT class="emphasis">Excellent endorsements:
  <DD>Cry the Beloved Mind has been enthusiastically endorsed by
  general readers, patients, fellow authors, psychiatrists, psychologists,
  academics, pharmacologists and other MDs.

Dr Vernon Neppe's new literary genre called 
<A class="std" HREF="/sciction/">sciction</A> is portrayed for the first time in his latest
book, <I>Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope</I>.</P>

<h3>For librarians to order for their libraries.</h3>

<CENTER><b><i>Why should my library stock <em>Cry
the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope</em>?</b></i></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Because it is a significant contribution, special,
important and will hopefully contribute to the needs of numerous
different groups.</CENTER></P>

<CENTER><b><i>Would you elaborate please?</i></b></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Read below and decide for yourself. We believe the
following groups will benefit from reading this book and having
it available in your library.</CENTER></P>

<DL>
  <DT class="emphasis">Self-help group:
  <DD>Cry the Beloved Mind is an important self-help resource relating
  brain medications to such conditions as depression, seizures,
  psychosis and unusual episodes. These conditions possibly impact
  on at least half the American population (as patients or family
  members or friends.)
  <DT class="emphasis">Students and colleagues in numerous health care areas:
  <DD>The book has even greater utility than patients, families
  of patients and the general reader. It has the potential market
  of undergraduate students in psychology, sociology, nursing and
  literature. It makes for an easy way to understand difficult
  concepts. Post-graduates students and colleagues in medicine,
  psychiatry, neurology. psychology and pharmacy should also benefit.
  <DT class="emphasis">English literature group:
  <DD>It is written in a new literary style, sciction-science through
  fiction based on composite factual patients. The special style
  involves a play within prose. The actual categorization of this
  book is non-fiction: the overriding feature is the medical science
  education; the vehicle is the literary style for easier, more
  fascinating educational reading.

<P CLASS="bold-italic"><CENTER>But are there emphases that make
the book special and even unique?</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>We believe there are. Please examine the evidence below.</CENTER></P>

<DL>
  <DT class="emphasis">Broad emphasis:

  It also discusses <EM>drug interactions</EM> and even <EM>herbal

  The book could almost be perceived as a play with commentary.
  <DT class="emphasis">Conversagraph:
  <DD>The author, Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD, has communicated via
  an unusual paragraph style-the conversagraph. How do we provide
  paragraphs for dialogue? Do we deliberately create different

  marks as in this book? Or do we introduce conversagraphs where
  the relevant dialogue on a single topic remains in the same paragraph.
