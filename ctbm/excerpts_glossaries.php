<h1 class=title>About the Glossaries</h1>



<p>

One of the most exciting parts of this book is the series of glossaries at the back of the book, aimed at increasing understanding of concepts.

</p>

<p>

The following Table of Contents sheds light on the breadth of the Glossary:

<h2 class=title>Glossary<br>Medical Terms</h2>



<p>

This glossary of one line definitions of medical terms is for quick reference to terms used in the context of this book. Consequently, wherever possible the definitions correspond with the short phrases associated with the em dash sign (--) that appear in the book.

</p>

<p>

The definitions are deliberately simplified for easier comprehension.
