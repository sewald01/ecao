<br><br>

<I>Cry the Beloved Mind</I> represents a series of voyages
in the pharmacology of psychiatry and neurology, reflecting a
single message: there is help for the anguished patient. <I>People
can be helped</I>, provided we are aware of the exact biochemical
or electrical abnormalities involved and we have the appropriate
interventions to alleviate the problems. Each of the twelve chapters
is a unique voyage directed toward the same destination of exploration
and hope.
<Br><br>
This book educates and stimulates. Didactic principles about
understanding symptoms and restoring health are interwoven with
patient portrayals to provide concrete examples of diagnostic
and therapeutic dilemmas. These techniques allow a focus on <I>medication
options</I>, which sometimes reflect important breakthroughs in
pharmacological knowledge. I hope the reader will share with me
some wonderful voyages of discovery. These include the first successful
treatment of profound tardive dyskinesia, the awakening of the
catatonic patient, the dousing of brain fires in both non-epileptic
psychotic and aggressive patients, and the normalization of patients
who have lost efficacy on antidepressants. However, the complex
solutions in this book portray more than a medical mystery. <I>Respect
and hope are the key themes of Cry the Beloved Mind.</I>
<br><br>
But the pharmacology of hope would be incomplete without the
crucial spice of this book: deliberate diversions that allow discussions
within each chapter to explore <I>social issues</I> such as normality,
cause and effect, searches for meaning, gun control, informed
consent, labeling of patients, generic substitution, alternative
herbal medicine, jet lag, regulation of medications, drug interactions,
historical perspectives in psychiatry, shock treatment, and techniques
such as measurement of brain waves at home.
<br><br>
Cry the Beloved Mind targets a <I>wide and diverse readership</I>.
Those seeking help for themselves or a family member should benefit.
Health care professionals and students of psychology, pharmacology
and medicine may profit greatly. Literary scholars may be interested
in the new style: sciction-science through fiction. Even the inquisitive
senior high school student may find the concepts embodied are
applicable during the iconoclasm of anomic adolescence. But most
of all, I have written this book for the curious layperson: You
can take pleasure in an ongoing medical and psychological detective
mystery spiced with the controversial and yet primarily aimed
at education and showing caring for others in need.
<br><br>
This book reflects my optimism that most problems linked with
brain abnormalities and behavioral difficulties can be treated.
Detailed clinical evaluation over many different sessions ensures
that <I>each individual's numerous unique characteristics </I>have
been carefully evaluated. Brief medical exams may contribute to
the truth, but turning a life around often requires more subtle
appreciation of the complexities. It is in this sense that the
sciction of this book reflects an approach that I have learned,
and am still learning: My many patients have taught me to look,
listen and apply whatever knowledge and skills I may have to help
their recovery.
<br><br>
The ideas in Cry the Beloved Mind are intended to flow as the
text within sections and chapters are connected closely with the
themes of the preceding ones. Yet, each chapter is a distinct
entity which can be read, and hopefully understood and appreciated,
on its own. Extreme facets are dramatized, yet the lessons that
emerge can be widely applied. A book such as this becomes a twelve
act play with different scenes in each chapter. The play calls
for an intensity that makes each patient atypical; but such unique
attributes exist within everyone.
<br><br>
The voyages described in this book reflect unusual patients
and therefore require unusual solutions. If these clients can
be helped, how much more so can the average patient improve? The
voyage of hope is an important one, but we should never lose a
sense of perspective. Most people with neurological and psychiatric
disorders reflect common problems with ordinary solutions which
respond well to appropriate medications. Most patients do not
need these innovative approaches.
<br><br>
No form of treatment is a panacea. While this book is intended
to communicate how, by detailed evaluation, even the most difficult
of patients may be helped by medication, it is not a comprehensive
didactic exposition on pharmacology or on psychiatric disease.
The appropriate medical specialist, not this book, should determine
how, why and when to use a specific drug. Exhaustive detail can
be found in standard texts.
<br><br>
All books have lofty hopes. So, too, does this one. My primary
hope is to help many in need, enhancing knowledge of medical and
neuropsychiatric conditions, and making way for further books
in the Cry the Beloved series. Toward this end, I also offer for
scrutiny the new literary direction of sciction.
