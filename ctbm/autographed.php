<H1 class="title" align="center">First Edition Autographed</H1>

<H3 class="title"><em>Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope</em> <BR>
Dr Vernon Neppe's acclaimed book,<BR>
and only here can you order first edition autographed copies.</H3>

<P>Although this cannot be guaranteed, it
is usual that autographed versions can become significantly more
valuable as collector's items.</P>

<P>Numerous determining factors are involved
but this being a first edition could make it more valuable. Pure
hearsay has the value of an autographed book being on average
three times that of a non-autographed book but we have not been
able to authenticate this. More well-established is the convention
that autographed books cannot be returned.</P>

<P>Perhaps the most important factor, however,
is the intrinsic value to the purchaser. Autographed books, like
autographed baseball cards, become a source of pride and often
achieve a prominent place in a bookshelf.</P>

<P>Why is this a bargain? A signature should substantially increase the collector's 
  value as this is the very first book defined in the new genre of <A class="std"
HREF="http://www.brainvoyage.com/sciction/">Sciction</A></I></B>.</P>

<P>1 copy $21.95 (reduced as $1 rebate from
$22.95) plus in the USA $6.95 shipping and handling for first
book and $1.50 shipping and handling for each additional book
(via priority mail).</P>

<P><B><I>You a small additional fee, you can get them <A class="std" HREF="/ctbm/personal.php#customized">customized</A>, or with a <A class="std" HREF="/ctbm/personal.php#personalized">personalized inscription</A> with your wording * <BR>
</I></B>(*at Dr Neppe's discretion and assuming his availability)</P>
