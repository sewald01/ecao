<font size="4">Welcome to our special "depression and anxiety" page. Let's learn, too, about the complex areas 
of mental illness and bipolar disorders.</font>

<p>But first we want to tell you about one of the most valued books ever on this topic: What readers 
have regarded as a "must get".<br><br>

<em>"Dr. Vernon Neppe has written one of the most important works dealing with 
  brain medications and social dilemmas ever penned. This book has helped me understand 
  that I am not alone, and that there is hope for a complete recovery. Dr. Neppe 
  has the rare ability to view his patients with both clinical detachment as well 
  as human beings, with fears, anguish, worry, terror and everything in between. 
  This wonderful volume should be required reading for anyone with curiosity or 
  concerns. "Cry The Beloved Mind" will change more than minds; it will change 
  LIVES!"</em> Karen (<a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/comments.php">For more comments click here</a>.) 

<p>Then follows Chapter 10: <em>The Deep Dark Pit</em>. Sometimes patients just cannot get out of their 
depression. Is there a solution? What about adjunctive antidepressant drugs like lithium, BuSpar, 
anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, thyroid, estrogen, ECT, beta-blockers, or antipsychotics? We 
learn about detailed drug histories and about hospitalization. What about the small group who have 
strange pain reactions? Is Prozac logical?</p>

<p>The trifecta climaxes with Chapter 11: <em>Three Steps Forward, One Step Back</em>. We interact with the 
doctor once more. We learn about an Adolescent this time who has experienced her antidepressants 
not working as they were before. We learn about educating and helping others. We see an amazing 
drug assisting Zoloft. A real voyage of new discovery again done in understandable terms.</p> 

<p>Of course, we've already learnt about many other areas like <em>Drug interactions. 
  Unbelievable, but this book makes us actually want to read about absorption, 
  metabolism, distribution and elimination of medications!</em> You may want to 
  understand about some of the basic aspects. We understand about the interactions 
  of cigarette smoke, the problems with jet lag, and even the role of Vitamin 
  B6. We are taken through analogies like boats and bathtubs and of course, coffee 
  and caffeine in anxiety.</p>

<p>But if you want to learn more about Cry the Beloved Mind and it's overall perspective, 
  go to our <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com">home page</a> --it is the featured 
  book--or if you want to order the book--author autographed and now the only source 
  for it--<a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/shop/catalog">click here</a>. 
  Or just click the link, if you want to go directly to more information on <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/shop/catalog">Cry 
  the Beloved Mind</a>. But how does the book read? Easily? Well, try it, and 
  here is a chapter on depression to boot: <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/excerpts_ch11.php">The 
  beginnings of Chapter 11</a> of Cry the Beloved Mind: A Voyage of Hope by Vernon 
  M Neppe MD, PhD. You can see this book is written in the special new literary genre of <a href="http://brainvoyage.com/sciction/index.php">sciction 
  - science through literature</a>. It "educates by fascination". And this just may be a reason why the author autographed 
  book may become a <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com/ctbm/autographed.php">collector's item</a>.</p>

<p>As a reader says about these sections after reading the book:</p>

<p><em>"WONDERFUL BOOK, EASY READ. No longer do you have to feel different or 
  alone in a world without hope or answers. This book gives the reader a great 
  deal of insight on mental health conditions and the different kinds of medications 
  used to treat them. I think anyone suffering from a mental condition, such as 
  depression will benefit from this book. As you read through the many different 
  chapters I am sure you will find somewhere or someone you will identify with 
  or see yourself in. It made me feel I wasn't the only one in the world on medications 
  for depression or a seizure related condition. I felt compelled to keep reading 
  and reading until I finished the book. I came away with a better understanding 
  of my own treatment and the way medications work in the treatment of these illnesses. 
  I would recommend this book to anyone who is suffering from a mental condition 
  or family and friends of anyone suffering from a mental condition. Dr. Neppe 
  has been able to bring this book down to a level that is easy to understand 
  and read, and at the same time is encouraging and yes, very 'HOPEFUL'."</em> 
  Cindy , BarnesandNoble.com review.</p>
