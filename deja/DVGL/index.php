<H1 class=title>D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: Glossary and Library</H1>

The internationally respected expert physician, Prof. Vernon Neppe, MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DFAPA, FFPsych, FRCPC, a psychiatrist, neuropsychiatrist, behavioral neurologist, forensic specialist  and psychopharmacologist also happens to be the world authority on the déjà vu phenomenon. 
<br><br>
The monographed book, D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: Glossary and Library, consists of two separate but clearly very related components: a Glossary of terms and a Library of references. 
<br><br>
The D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Glossary is a list of over 360 terms, over thirty-four pages relating to déjà vu and the orbit of related psychological, psychiatric, neurological, phenomenological, parapsychological and literary concepts. The scientific study of déjà vu impacts all these disciplines. Each term is given a capsule definition, precise enough for the scientist, yet comprehensible to the intelligent lay reader. This glossary represents the fruit of years of research and preparation for two companion volumes which I have recently published on that fascinating phenomenon of déjà vu: D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Revisited1—a new rewrite of what is regarded by other experts as the classic in the field, The Psychology of D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: Have I Been Here Before?2 published in 1983; and D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: A Second Look,3 a compendium of the past quarter century of scientific research on déjà vu along with new analyses of the present state and future prospects for a science of déjà vu.
<br><br>
Whereas the books D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Revisited1 and D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: A Second Look3 are easily searchable in their PDF formats and can be printed, for copyright reasons they cannot be cut or pasted. This PDF version of the D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: Glossary and Library allows flexibility because, within the frameworks of appropriate consents relating to published material, and using the appropriate Adobe Reader or other software, the reader may be able to copy and paste  glossary entries and references, and amplify their book with notes. Please E-Mail Library comments to library@brainvoyage.com and Glossary comments to glossary@brainvoyage.com.
<br><br>
The second part of this book D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: Glossary and Library consists of the Library, which is as relevant for serious scholars on déjà vu as the glossary is.
<br><br>
If you were to do a search over the Internet, you would locate tens of thousands of articles, URLs, newspaper reports and blogged comments on déjà vu. You would even locate nightclubs or perfumes. But very few of these searches will genuinely reflect the déjà vu phenomenon. Even more problematic is the difficulty of locating real déjà vu by searching with the appropriate French accents. This book addresses the concern in both the library and glossary sections.
<br><br>
The D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Library also represents the fruit of many years of research and preparation for my two companion volumes on that strange and fascinating phenomenon of déjà vu: D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Revisited1 and D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: A Second Look,3 . These volumes allow for appreciation of the present and future state of research and interpretation of the  déjà vu phenomenon. This Library contributes a certain historicity.
<br><br>
At about seventy pages in length, the D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Library is a formidable collection of scholarly and literary references used in both D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Revisited1 and D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: A Second Look,3 as well as in the literature at large. As such, the citations embody most of the key and core articles and books on a variety of subjects of the past century and longer impacting a multitude of medical, psychological, neurological, phenomenological, parapsychological and literary disciplines, as well as many classic studies that go back a good century or more, to that interesting period during the birth of modern psychology and brain science, the late 19th century. 
<br><br>
This electronic book (E-Book) is effectively a compendium of nearly eight hundred references, not only including those that were used as endnotes in D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Revisited1 and its companion volume D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: A Second Look3—but also including many related articles and books that readers may find of interest in their broader pursuit of learning about déjà vu.               <br><br>
