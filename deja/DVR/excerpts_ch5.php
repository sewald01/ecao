<h2 class=title>RESULTS OF THE NORMAL GROUPS</h2>

<p>
The Subjective Paranormal Non-experients
<br><br>
Numerous case descriptions now follow. Only cases illustrating specific themes have been chosen, many in markedly abridged forms.34
<br><br>
Illustration 1
<br><br>
How can such déjà vu be interesting?
<br><br>
The déjà vu phenomenon appears to include a wide spectrum of events ranging from the mundane to the fascinating. Experiences such as this may be simple, but they interest the researcher because they illustrate a basic theme—in this instance, the typical associative kind of déjà vu experienced by ‘Mr. Average’. In this case, the subject (SPNE: Subject D), a 22-year-old social worker, was better called ‘Miss Average’.
<br><br>
We were traveling in a car. We went past a building which I saw through the trees. I got the feeling that I had been there previously, but actually it was the first time I had seen it. I thought, “I’m imagining it, I’ve never been here.”
<br><br>
This experience had occurred one month before the interview in an area of Johannesburg she had never visited before. She was in a car with her family at the time.
<br><br>
Qualitative Elaboration
<br><br>
This experience was quite vivid, involved recognition only of a part of the surroundings (only the building), and was ‘remembered in most details’. These experiences occurred very rarely for her, though when they did, they were usually of this kind. In this regard, the experience fits the prototype of associative déjà vu.
<br><br>
The only unusual feature she experienced was a feeling of mild depersonalization while having it.
