<H1 align="center" CLASS="title">Excerpts from selected chapters of D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Revisited</H1>

<br><br>
Chapters: The following are small sections from Chapters 1, 5, and 8.
<br><br>
You have the opportunity to view excerpts of an undisputed classic in the field of déjà vu research, a rewrite of Dr. Neppe’s seminal 1983 work, The Psychology of D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: Have I Been Here Before?  It has been modified and updated only to the extent that it may be made more accessible to the intelligent lay reader and to scientists outside the field, while none of the scientific rigor of the original that does justice to the complexity of the phenomenon has been sacrificed.
<br><br>
The purpose is to give you a flavor of how wonderful this book is: It educates by fascination; and it is aimed at you: the general reader, the patient, the family member, colleagues and students in the psychological, medical and pharmacy disciplines.
<br><br>
The chapter excerpts below obviously do not have the sophisticated font and other formatting that is in the electronic and book versions.
<br><br>
ENJOY!
