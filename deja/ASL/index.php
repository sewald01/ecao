    <td width="75%" valign="top"> The internationally respected expert physician, Prof. Vernon Neppe, MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DFAPA, FFPsych, FRCPC, a psychiatrist, neuropsychiatrist, behavioral neurologist, forensic specialist  and psychopharmacologist also happens to be the world authority on the déjà vu phenomenon. 
<br><br>
What is that uncanny phenomenon we call “déjà vu”?
<br><br>
What causes it?  What is it trying to tell us?
<br><br>
Does it reveal significant things about our psychology?
<br><br>
What glimpses does it provide into our brain chemistry?
<br><br>
What does it say about our human nature?
<br><br>
Is there only one kind of déjà vu, or are there perhaps many kinds?
<br><br>
What is “normal” déjà vu, and how does it differ from other types?
<br><br>
How can scientific researchers learn more about this strange experience?
<br><br>
Can ordinary people using the Internet help science uncover more information about déjà vu by participating in an on-line questionnaire?
<br><br>
Does déjà vu somehow provide access to mysteries of time, existence, or past lives?
<br><br>
In his book D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: A Second Look, Dr Vernon M Neppe has provided an indispensable companion volume to D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Revisited, his 2006 rewrite of his 1983 classic on the subject, The Psychology of D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: Have I Been Here Before?  In this companion volume, D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu: A Second Look, Dr Neppe has not only performed a much needed service to the scientific and lay communities of compiling and updating key articles about déjà vu research over the past quarter century: Dr Neppe, along with his collaborator Dr Funkhouser, one of the world’s leading authorities on the subject of déjà vu, have contributed new chapters of unprecedented insight and analysis into fundamental questions concerning the nature, the history, frequency, and the future of déjà vu science. New tools for research into the field are presented here, including the culminating chapter of this book, where a new questionnaire—the New Neppe D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu Questionnaire 2006—is offered as a comprehensive computerized instrument for measuring déjà vu both quantitatively and qualitatively on the Internet.
<br><br>
This has been perceived by experts as the most important book on the subject of déjà vu.
