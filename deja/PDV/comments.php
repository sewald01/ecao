<i> “Dr. Neppe has provided us with his original milestone text which, though published in 1983, remains an invaluable resource for anyone wishing to delve into the complexities associated with the intriguing and fascinating phenomenon we commonly call ‘deja vu’. The breadth of factual knowledge he presents there and the fineness of the distinctions he discussed are as topical and valuable today as they were 23 years ago.”</i>
<blockquote>
Dr Art Funkhouser, Switzerland; a  leading expert on deja vu and subeditor of Deja Vu: A Second Look

<i> “This is probably the first scientific work of its kind on the subject of deja vu and the book must therefore be hailed as a pioneering venture… There is no doubt regarding the wealth of source material, biological, psychiatric, psychological, and literary… For sheer range of reference material, the book… may be expected to furnish researchable ideas for many years to come.”</i>

<i> “… an exciting exploration of a most intriguing phenomenon…”</i>
<blockquote>
Frederic F. Flach, MD on Dr Neppe’s original Psychology of Déjà Vu

<i> “Dr. Neppe’s descriptions and analyses of deja vu throughout his book are unique… he has suspended all his presuppositions, prejudices and beliefs and has gone back to the experiences themselves… through Dr. Neppe’s brilliant phenomenological analysis of the experience… [he] thus provides scientists with thoroughly clarified concepts and basic concepts that can be used scientifically …For sheer range of reference material, … may be expected to furnish researchable ideas for many years to come …” </i>
<blockquote>
 Dr. Maarten Kramers, late Principal Psychiatrist, U. Witwatersrand, South Africa on Dr Neppe’s original Psychology of Déjà Vu.

<i> “It's rare to see a strand of yarn separated so delicately and  methodically into its multitude of separate strands. Each respective fiber placed appropriately and carefully in an extensive analysis creating a magnificent whole. This is remarkable for deja vu, with each component distinguished from each other.”</i>
