<i>"From now on, anyone wishing to learn about the various forms of
déjà experience will have to look no further than
this treasure trove of information for a glossary of terms.
And researchers wishing to know what has already been accomplished in this field now have a resource
that will save invaluable time
in accessing the wealth of thinking and empirical investigations
accumulated over the past one hundred and some odd years.
…an invaluable resource…in breadth of factual knowledge.

<p><i> “For those with scientific interest in the study of the deja vu experience, this book is an invaluable point of reference and a mine of information. The authors demonstrate once again that the study of this intriguing phenomenon may serve as vantage point for the study of the processes of memory storage and perception.” </i>

</p></blockquote>


<hr width="50%">
<p><i> “Deja Vu: A Second Look is an exceptional presentation of the widely known, but poorly understood, concept of deja vu. Dr. Neppe masterfully weaves a literature review with illustrative examples to create a book that is highly recommended to anyone with interest in this fascinating topic.

<br />Clearly, the definitive work on deja vu." </i>
