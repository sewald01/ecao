<H1 align="center" CLASS="title">Excerpts plus overview from Reality Begins with Consciousness</H1>

<br><br>
Chapters: The following are small sections from Chapters 1, 4. 
<br><br>
In reality, chapters obviously
are linked with the previous ones but have been written so that
they also stand alone. 
<br><br>
The chapters below obviously
do not have the sophisticated font and other formatting that is
in the electronic and book versions.
<br><br>
The purpose is to give you
a flavor of how wonderful this book is: It educates by fascination;
and it is aimed at you: the general reader, the patient, the family
member, colleagues and students in the psychological, medical
and pharmacy disciplines.
<br><br>
ENJOY!
