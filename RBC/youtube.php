We have created a series of YouTubes that you may find illuminating. Our target is generally the intelligent layperson but sometimes scientists may find them useful too. Most of these YouTubes are short. Many cover the book Reality Begins with Consciousness and the Triadic Dimensional Distinction Vortical Model.
<br /><br />
We are gradually hoping to add to those that are available and to modify them with updates. We are intending to include new books, and some of our other books and some important concepts. <b>We have numbered them in the order suggested for your watching.</b> You can follow the best order by the numbers. E.g. start with 1. Theory of Everything (TOE), then 2. Dimensions etc. 
<br /><br />
We redirect the links here to another site (<a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.org" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.org</a>) that is housing these links but continually being updated. 
<br /><br />
You may want to bookmark the following two pages so you can return if you go off this site:
 <br /><br />
1. If you want to see the Vernon Neppe gateway go to <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.org" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.org</a> main page.
<br /><br />
Please remember that we hope that <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.org" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.org</a> will become the logical stepping stone not only for <br />
<ul>
<li>presentations , but for: </li>
<li>media, </li>
<li>press releases, </li>
<li>contacts and </li>
<li>events; and for </li>
<li>research, </li>
<li>forensics, </li>
<li>clinical and </li>
<li>books. </li>
<li>A blog is continually in process at <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.org" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.org</a>  or <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.com" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.com</a></li>
<li>And you can use VernonNeppe.com as a stepping stone visiting some other sites linked with Dr. Neppe such as </li>
<ul>
<li>Pacific Neuropsychiatric Institute with Dr Neppe's clinical, forensic, research and other data: www.pni.org, </li>
<li>Dr Neppe's books <a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com" target="_blank">www.brainvoyagge.com</a>, </li>
<li>Exceptional Creative Achievement Organization at www.ecao.us (also known as <a href="http://5KIQ.com" target="_blank">5KIQ.com</a> and <a href="http://5eca.com" target="_blank">5eca.com</a>) and at some point</li>
<li>A site in process continually: <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.com" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.com</a></li>
</ul>

2. Our audio-video presentations page at  <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.org/presents.html" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.org/presents.html</a>      
<br /><br />
This way you will see all the completed Neppe and Close links of YouTubes or other Audio and Video and those being planned. Please note that the links may become out of date because significant YouTube edits require modification in I-Movie or related programs.  Therefore the links to the audio-video are examples, and you can always search under the title.  You can also go directly to www.YouTube.com and to search under our special headers: Brainvoyage or VMNBVPNI or TDVP or under Vernon Neppe or Edward Close or you can locate a specific title e.g. Tethering. 
<br /><br />
The links are listed under <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.org/presents.html" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.org/presents.html</a>  or you can navigate through from <a href="http://www.VernonNeppe.org" target="_blank">www.VernonNeppe.org</a>  as the Vernon Neppe gateway.
<br /><br />
