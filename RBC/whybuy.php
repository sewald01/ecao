<BR><BR>
Renowned international Consciousness Researcher, Prof. Vernon Neppe, MD, PhD, FRSSAf, DFAPA, and International Consultant Physicist/Mathematician, Dr. Edward R. Close PhD, PE, have joined together to develop a Theory of Everything that shifts the current scientific paradigm, and profoundly challenges the current perspectives of consciousness and reality. Their model is based on science, yet supported by mathematics. It's a must-read for all scientists, philosophers, or thinkers. Despite their breakthrough discoveries impacting millions, this book is regarded by the authors as their life's work: Reality Begins with Consciousness describes a comprehensive paradigm shift in all the sciences--physical, biological, psychological and consciousness, and incorporates (readable) mathematical proofs, philosophy and philosophy of science. It's been described by different international scientists as "destined to become a classic", "masterpiece", "should be appreciated for centuries to come", "paradigm shift", "encyclopedic", "long awaited unification". Every chapter challenges and stimulates allowing a greater understanding of our world. Written partly for scientists and creative thinkers, interested General Readers have enriched themselves, too. This book is a bargain because of the initial sale price of about 40% off, and it containing possibly the first electronic inscription to the reader in an E-book.
