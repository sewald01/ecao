<br /><br />

<b>Reality Begins with Consciousness: A Paradigm Shift that Works. Vernon M Neppe and Edward R. Close.</b>  

<h2>Versions:</h2>
Available only as an E-book electronic, downloadable book from this site exclusively (<a href="http://www.brainvoyage.com">www.brainvoyage.com</a>).  
<br /><br />

<h2>Why is this potentially a collector's item.</h2> 
<b>This is interesting as it has some unique features. The First Edition being the first and with an autograph initially restricted to the first 200 E-books, but now open again to the public, is likely the best for demonstrating Collector's authenticity.</b>
<br /><br />
<b>The Ebooks may be valuable anyway if the Neppe-Close TDVP model is demonstrable.</b>
<br /><br />
<h2>First Edition (Released November 2011, though 2012 date).</h2>
--now surpassed significantly in content but contains that first  special electronic inscription to the reader. It becomes potentially valuable if it is, as we think, the first Ebook to do this. ( &copy; and patent pending).  $32.99. The Deluxe Second Edition continues this pattern not only with an open format but the autographed E-book so some may prefer that.
<br /><br />

Several later  versions  exist. We believe the Fourth Edition Deluxe is also potentially a Collector's item but for a different reason. It contains what may be a landmark finding that is publicly announced.
<br /><br />

Of course, there are journal articles but these are in press or in submission and this makes this book the first to demonstrate a 9 dimensional spin finite model. This is huge for our concepts of reality.
<br /><br />


<b>RECOMMENDED:</b> The Deluxe 4th Edition still contains the same unique special inscription to the reader. It also allows for open PDF format so that you can extract and add information using the full version of Adobe Acrobat Reader e.g. Go to the Acrobat menu and under Tools/Comment and Markup/ Sticky Menu or Text Edits (you can copy and paste e.g. into MSWord). Plus it has EPUB and MOBI plus a complimentary second shorter Ebook Glimpses and Glossary. Special sale price.<br /><br /> 
The Standard Edition no longer exists.   <br /><br />
We're also offering a combination buying the 1st Edition and the 4th Deluxe edition for a special price.    
<br /><br />

<h2>Proof:</h2>  
It will need certification that this was a genuine order. That is a simple but unique fingerprint with the original proof held by the publisher.
<br /><br />
<h2>Certification of authenticity</h2>
You can also further purchase a certification of authenticity that this is a genuine collector's version for $18.85 but it will be $13.85 after the $5 discount for each item after the first--so with your order). (If you have not yet done so, yet purchased, log in on brainvoyage.com and order.
Exclusively available: www.brainvoyage.com)
