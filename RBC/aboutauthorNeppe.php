<img src="/images/neppe_thumb.jpg" align="left">
Based on peer-reviewed publications, presentations, international honors and medicolegal consultations, Prof. Vernon Neppe has achieved an international reputation in numerous and diverse disciplines. These include:
<br><br>
&bull;&nbsp;five fundamental but related medical specialties, namely Neuropsychiatry, Behavioral Neurology, Psychopharmacology, Forensic Psychiatry and Neuropsychiatry, and Psychiatry: In all these specialties, he has been listed under “America’s Top Doctors”—and he is one of the few to be listed in all ten issues of this peer-reviewed book and, is apparently, the only physician ever listed in five different subspecialties. 
<br><br>
&bull;&nbsp;Consciousness Research, Phenomenology, Epileptology and Neuroscience, in which his contributions have been pioneering and prodigious, and he is also
<br><br>
&bull;&nbsp;an internationally in demand Professional Speaker, Author and Playwright. 
<br><br>	
Dr. Neppe has pioneered numerous pharmacological areas. These include adjunctive anticonvulsants in psychiatry (these contributions alone have impacted the lives of millions of people), and a successful treatment for the previously incurable tardive dyskinesia. He has described four new medical conditions, invented about a hundred new terms, suggested three major new classifications, developed more than thirty evaluations, tests and historical screens in neuropsychiatry and consciousness, pioneered several new theoretical concepts in his disciplines, and developed the literary genre of sciction. 
<br><br>	
Additionally, he pioneered the links of brain function and subjective experience, is the world authority on déjà vu phenomena, and developed Phenomenology in the Neuroscience and Consciousness contexts. The author of nine books, including Cry the Beloved Mind 2, and two plays (www.brainvoyage.com), he has overall more than 400 publications on every continent. He has lectured in twelve countries, chaired international symposia, and worked internationally with the media and led the 1st USA and International Delegation in Neuropsychiatry and Psychopharmacology. 
<br><br>	
Originally from South Africa (where he mainly trained, with a Fellowship at Cornell University, New York, thereafter), he established the first Division of Neuropsychiatry in a USA Psychiatry Department (University of Washington), and then a model institute (Pacific Neuropsychiatric Institute —PNI), which he directs (<a href="http://www.pni.org"  target=_blank>www.pni.org</a>). He is also (Adj. Full) Professor, Dept of Neurology and Psychiatry, St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO. He was the first USA based MD to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of SA, is a Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, recipient of the Marius Valkhoff prize, one of the rare Diplomates of the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry (ISPE) (<a href="http://www.thethousand.com"  target=_blank>www.thethousand.com</a>), and Executive Director of the Exceptional Creative Achievement Organization (<a href="http://5eca.com" target=_blank>5eca.com</a>).  <a href="mailto:tdvp@pni.org">tdvp@pni.org</a>.
