<h3>Comments & Reviews</h3>
<h2>Reality Begins With Consciousness: A paradigm shift that works</h2>
<h3>By Dr. Vernon M. Neppe and Dr. Edward Close</h3>
<br /><br />
<p style="text-align: left;">
Prior to publication this book was circulated to readers, peer-reviewers and referees in twenty-two countries. The great majority were established scientists, leaders in the area of consciousness research or highly creative individuals. We have further received feedback after publication. Overall, we've received feedback from tens of peer scientists and creative readers.<br /><br />
 We have divided the comments into two groups and these represent six countries:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Prominent scientists. We ensure that all the sciences (psychological, physical, life, and consciousness) and mathematics are represented, plus philosophy and philosophy of science.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Intelligent general readers. We again ensure a spectrum is represented.

<h2>Psychological Sciences</h2>
<em>Vernon M. Neppe and Edward R. Close have written what is destined to become a classic in the literature on shifting paradigms and worldviews. Drawing from a dozen different disciplines, they have adroitly pointed out the limitations of the Western world's currently accepted model of reality, have spelled out the unfortunate consequences of this model's hegemony, have proposed a paradigm that is not only multidimensional but metadimensional, and have supported it with logic, mathematics, research data, and common sense. The implications that this book has for the betterment of humanity makes for worthwhile, illuminating and enlightening reading which is practical and transformative.</em>

<h2>Neurosciences</h2>
<em>What an astonishing and prodigious accomplishment! The way the authors communicate their profound insights both from our usual "bottom-up" experience as well as from the "top-down" higher realities facilitates engaging readers in this unique and groundbreaking scientific model: We're able to swim longer in the vast subtle and not-so-subtle cosmic pond--and the references provide handholds to keep us afloat. I kept flashing on a museum installation that would allow people to have a "walking around in" experience of climbing through dimensional rifts (in music: ostinati) and connect all around with vortical interactions. I guess this comes from years of my interpreting to people the leaps in transformation I see continually emerging in Neurofeedback work: The Neppe-Close paradigm now provides for a much more coherent way to understand reality. Once introduced, the actualities of these unifying concepts begin to live. It is quite stunning to observe people speaking from an "already having changed" perspective...a thrilling journey! </em>

<h2>Life Sciences</h2>
<em>Scientific revolutions require both empirical evidence and related coherent explanatory frameworks. The encyclopedic book "Reality Begins with Consciousness" leads in providing the sought after broader scientific unification linking the neurosciences, consciousness, biological, psychological and the physical sciences with math-based logical philosophy and spirituality. Drs Neppe and Close provide a missing broad exploratory paradigm for new scientific ideas that can continue to be researched for many years to come. Whether or not this multidisciplinary model is ultimately viable, the cogent supportive data should encourage scientists to explore seriously the underlying ideas; the models presented go further than other volumes. </em>

<h2>Philosophy of Science </h2>
<em>Prof. Vernon Neppe and Dr. Edward Close have prepared a much-needed volume that aims to integrate our scientific knowledge into a comprehensive natural-law paradigm. Their work leaves no stone unturned in the quest to re-configure our understanding of science, including those more remote or fringe areas of science such as parapsychology that only a few of our highly respected and honored scientists are brave enough to endorse. This new book by Neppe and Close is a paradigm shift that hails in, if not, beckons for, a kind of scientific overhaul and shift in thinking that Thomas Kuhn spoke of in his major work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.</em>

<h2>Physical Sciences</h2>
<em>This is the book of books. Close and Neppe have succeeded in articulating a unified theory that explains everything known through human experience and observation, including, not only the data obtained by the five senses, but also the data that comes through mind and feeling. Former scientific thought has considered the material universe to be the total universe with consciousness to be the result of matter. Neppe and Close have shown the reverse. Matter is inseparably linked with consciousness. They have succeeded in the ultra-complex task of including everything we know through the material laws of Classical Physics, Quantum Physics, and Relativity, with the non-material observations gained through psychology, parapsychology, and spiritual vision, into a unified metaparadigm with consciousness as the foundation of all creation, including the origin of creation, itself. This is a book you will want to study, absorb, and return to again and again to experience the thrill of understanding how the billions of bits of the universe all fit together as a unified whole, and how we are a participatory part of everything. The authors' many years of labor will be appreciated for centuries to come. </em>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<em>This authoritative work in consciousness studies will shape philosophical discourse about mentality and mind. It is a serious and lucid exploration of a most complex topic, suitable for philosophers and cognitive scientists who seek explanatory models that allow one to reach beyond methodological boundaries while at the same time adhering to scholarly rigor. Recognizing consciousness without boundaries and as formative action leads to unexpected conclusions outside any normative space, while at the same time providing a profound value to the future of humankind. Neppe and Close have masterfully demonstrated that hope is inside and outside Pandora's box. </em>

<em>I'm still completing this, but your book is impressive. It seems astonishing that you could combine deep scientific notions with mysticism. I never knew that such work was possible.</em>

<h2>Multidisciplinary Sciences</h2>
<em>Most physical TOEs (theories of everything) fail because they don't explain where the TOE comes from in the first place -- a creative act of consciousness. Most psychological TOEs fail because they don't appreciate the very real physical context in which the psyche struggles to explain itself. Reality Begins with Consciousness (RBC) avoids these mistakes by taking a TOE's promise of "everything" seriously. This puts RBC in a radical multidisciplinary class by itself, and as a result, understanding it is nontrivial. This should not be surprising, for unadorned Reality as-it-is is vast and hyper-complex, and any TOE that hopes to model that Reality must be equally vast and complex. But for readers who are up to the challenge and are able to stretch their minds in many directions, tackling RBC is well worth it. </em>

<em>I couldn't put it down last night: Very few books grab my attention enough to force me to stay up past my normal bedtime. And this is one of those books.</em>
<h3>Russell Rebman, Fort Worth, TX, United States.</h3>
<br /><br />
<em>	I've been reading your book a bit at a time, absorbing it... Quite the complex read, but fascinating. </em>
<h3>Ron Dinelle, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</h3>
<br /><br />
<em>I can say that if I can understand your information, it is likely that anyone reading it can... I believe you have reached your goal to "dumb it down" to the level where those of us who are both linguistically challenged and are not scientists can grasp and comprehend what you are saying--I believe that the material is just that good...a fine work.</em> 
<h3>Rob Abbott, Port Orchard, WA, United States.</h3>
<br /><br />
<em>Wow. I feel like I am back in graduate school while reading through your work! What a wonderful experience.</em>
<h3>Karen Miller, Buffalo, NY, United States.</h3>
<br /><br />
<em>Broad in scope, multidisciplinary in approach, this monumental work is more than food for thought - it's a feast. If consciousness shapes reality, then you may well adjust your own after reading this book.</em>
<h3>James Hardenbergh, Seattle, WA, United States.</h3>
<br /><br />
<em>Without proper scientific evidence or reasoning, consciousness has, for years, been treated as a secondary phenomenon that is somehow derived purely from materialistic origins. There is actually no scientific proof that this is true. I am glad, therefore, that Vernon Neppe and Edward Close have taken on this monumental task of addressing this unwarranted bias in scientific thinking.</em>
