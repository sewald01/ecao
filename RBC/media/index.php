<h2>Why should  the media choose for Dr Neppe and his book Reality Begins with Consciousness</h2>
Why should I, as a media person, regard this book and Dr. Vernon Neppe and / or his co-author, Dr Edward Close. any differently from the hundreds of requests I receive per year for interviews, reviews and articles? Dr Close himself is very distinguished and highly recommended, but this media section focuses on Professor Neppe.
<br><br>
<h1>Reality Begins with Consciousness and the author Vernon M Neppe MD, PhD, FRS (SAf), DFAPA, BN&NP, DSPE etc  present so many diverse areas for potential radio, TV and newspaper interviews, news snippets, guest lectures, plenary conferences, and presenations.</h1>
<br />
<h2>Need an expert or are you wanting to introduce new niches? Consider interviewing Professor Neppe!</h2>
<em><i>But why interview Dr. Neppe?</i></em>
Because he is an excellent raconteur, experienced with the media (TV, radio, newspapers and professional international speaker --dozen countries), has persuasive skills and is prepared to debate issues. His ease with the media linked with his extensive teaching and public speaking experience as well as his medicolegal expertise and creativity is a distinct plus.<br /><br />
<em><i>Why not obtain  Dr. Neppe as a guest speaker?</i></em><br />

That would be logical. He electrifies audiences, speaks with humor and has a special way of engaging audiences. He has delivered well over a thousand professional lectures and speeches. He handles questions easily, and can speak off the cuff if necessary. An extremely in demand commodity!
<br><br>
<em><i>But what about expertise?</i></em><br />
He is a recognized international expert in the fields of Consciousness Research and Dimensional Biopsychophysics,  Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurology psychopharmacology, forensics and psychiatry. He has been and is listed in Who's Who in the World,  America's Top Doctors  (every issue) in five different specialties and subspecialties (only person ever?) ,  and numerous different awards. He is one of the rare Diplomates of the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry  (thethousand.com) and the only Distinguished Professor of the Exceptional Creative Achievement Organization (5eca.com)
<br><br>
<h1>His major contributions make him newsworthy.</h1>


<p>The work of Dr Close and Dr Neppe simply has changed the perspective of Reality. Imagine our finite reality being a 9 dimensional spin model. We always thought it was 3 dimensions of space and one moment in time. Now we know most of reality is hidden.</P>

<em>How huge is that?</em>
VERY HUGE!  IT FORCES MANY SCIENTISTS TO UNTHINK WHAT THEY HAVE THOUGHT BEFORE. The implications may be one of the profound findings this century.
And this data on peer-review  appears sound.


<em>What other recent examples exist?</em>
<ul>
<li>It was he that the media turned to when they wanted clarity on the famous amnesia case of the Tacoma reporter Jody Roberts. It was he that the media were prepared to fly across country to discuss the profile of the terrorist attacker in Marseilles (he refused)</li>
<li>It was he whom Italian Television flew around the world to interview on Deja Vu. </li>
<li>It was he who is greatly in demand in programs such as Coast to Coast. </li>
<li>Dr Neppe and Dr Close received the Gabino Barreda Award, recognizing their contributions to science and education (February 2013, Puebla, Mexico).</li>

<em><i>What recent example?</i></em><br />
It was he that the media turned to when they wanted clarity on the famous amnesia case of the Tacoma reporter Jody Roberts. It was he that the media were prepared to fly across country to discuss the profile of the terrorist attacker in Marseilles (he refused). It was he whom Italian Televsion flew around the world to interview on Deja Vu. It was he who is greatly in demand in programs such as Coast to Coast.

<br><br>
<em><i>Could we use him for other issues, besides the book?</i></em><br />
Most certainly. Dr. Neppe could recently have been interviewed in relation to the gun control issues that have been topical. He is an expert on memory, brain function, strange behaviors, depression, aggression, the paranormal, brain disease, consciousness, reality, philosophy, exceptional intelligence, creativity, psychosis, reality, positive attitudes, generic substitution, nutritional supplements and seizures.

<br><br>
<em><i>There are also issues of relevance to his book?</i></em><br />
His book  Reality Begins with Consciousness is a prime example of pioneering creative thinking that truly is changing thinking in the world. It is fundemantal to all of reality and answers questions never before solved.

<br><br>
<em><i>There are also issues of relevance to his book?</i></em><br />
Indeed, he can express expert opinions on medicine and the law, psychiatry, normality, reality, models for science, philosophy, the paranormal,  the infinite, normality, the how of life (very exciting),  even search for meaning, and good and evil and how on freedom of choice and life after death.
