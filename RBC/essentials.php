<H1 CLASS="title">What exactly are the essential elements of the TDVP model of Neppe and Close?</H1>
<br /><br />

<h2>Primary</h2>
&bull;&nbsp;Space, time and consciousness (S, T, C) are tethered together.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;STC tethering occurs in both the finite and infinite subrealities.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;The whole reality is made up of infinite subreality which necessarily always impacts the finite subreality and vice versa. 

<br />&bull;&nbsp;The infinite subreality is continuous, without end, the finite is discrete.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;We experience reality as sentient beings "bottoms-up" in the most basic reality 3S-1t-1C as STC is inseparable (so 3S-1t without C is illusory though commonly interpreted as such).

<br />&bull;&nbsp;All higher consciousness and all of N-C is ultimately integrated through that finite 3S-1t-1C physical living component called consciousness in the nervous system in sentient beings.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;We cannot perceive almost all of reality and we need to conceptualize reality experiences outside 3S-1t.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;STC began in the finite at its origin.
<br />&bull;&nbsp;In the infinite, there was no origin. All time, space and information are pervasive, unextended, without end and without beginning.


<br /><br /><h2>Secondary</h2>
&bull;&nbsp;We exist in a finite 3S-3T-3C as a minimum, though we cannot perceive that.
<br />&bull;&nbsp;There are N-dimensions of finite subreality extending through the transfinite. These are generally N-C. Approaching reality from there is the "top-down" approach, where only some pieces of the multidimensional jigsaw puzzle may appear in 3S-1t.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;In the infinite subreality, STC exists without end, unextended but specifically when representing the finite it is extended in that individual unit context.

<br /><br /><h2>Tertiary</h2>
&bull;&nbsp;Communication through dimensions is via a process (called "indivension" ) utilizing zillions of (content) "vortices ( interfacing with vectors, scalars, tensors) to produce vast finite and infinite interfacing tracks.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;A model for understanding the apprehension and manipulation of objects or events (psi) is provided including the ostensible rare events, precognition and retrocognition, and freedom of choice.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;The infinite has several elements all existing together:
<br />&bull;&nbsp;metaspace
<br />&bull;&nbsp;metatime
<br />&bull;&nbsp;metaconsciousness (meaningful metainformaition)
<br />&bull;&nbsp;metalife (polife = potential life in the finite)
<br />&bull;&nbsp;metaorder (ordropy)

<br /><br /><h2>Quaternary</h2>
&bull;&nbsp;Life always exists in the infinite reality and therefore it is automatic in the finite explaining the how of life. ( How life comes about; It never needs to because it is always there in the infinite subreality)

<br />&bull;&nbsp;We do not know how to appreciate the infinite but exist in certain modifiable finite tracks that derive from the infinite.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;Order always exists in the infinite eternally and pervades the finite as multidimensional ordropy.
<br />&bull;&nbsp;Entropy always exists in the finite and impacts the infinite.

<br />&bull;&nbsp;Meaningful information is called metaconsicousness in the infinite.
