<h1>Edward R. Close PhD, PE, SFSPE</h1> 
<img src="ThumbEdClose.jpg" align="left">Edward R. Close is a Physicist, Mathematician, Cosmologist, Environmental Engineer and Planner, and international consultant. He was a charter member of the U.S.G.S. Systems Analysis Group where he developed state-of-the-art mathematical optimization programs, hierarchical modeling techniques and fractal geometry models of coastal geomorphology, storm cell development and other environmental modeling applications. 
<br /><br />
Pursuing an active research program in environmental remediation, he has made a series of breakthrough discoveries in using non-toxic compounds in mold research that have benefited millions. He is a charter member of the internationally known Integrated Health-Care Professionals Council. He has authored numerous technical papers and five books, including the groundbreaking "Transcendental Physics, Integrating the Search for Truth". He developed the mathematical "calculus of distinctions", which is very relevant in the current book. He described a brief (several pages), but never refuted first published proof for the famous Fermat's Last Theorem 3, which will appear in the companion volume to this book, Space, Time and Consciousness: The Tethered Triad. He has also developed several new theorems of consciousness, and contributed important engineering applications. 
<br /><br />
Dr. Close is Principal Engineer and Director of Research and Development at EJC Advantage, LLC. He is currently Science Editor of Telicom (journal of the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry (ISPE) (<a href="http://www.thethousand.com" target=_blank>www.thethousand.com</a>), and also a Fellow of the Exceptional Creative Achievement Organization (<a href="http://5eca.com" tageet=_blank>5eca.com</a>). 
<br /><br />
Both Dr. Neppe and Dr. Close can be regarded as pioneers of the new interdisciplinary science of Dimensional Biopsychophysics, in which dimensionometry, consciousness and the interface of the biological, psychological and physical are integrated together, as in their remarkably innovative model of the Triadic Dimensional Distinction Vortical Paradigm. <a href="mailto:eclose@ejcenterprises.com">eclose@ejcenterprises.com</a>
