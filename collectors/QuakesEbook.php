Dr Vernon Neppe developed the  new defined literary genre of sciction  in his landmark book, Cry the Beloved Mind; A Voyage of Hope  a potential Collector's item.
It was unique: It was not only the first book written in the defined literary genre of sciction. 
Also Dr Neppe developed Conversagraphs, and the longest published real word in the English language at that time  Ethicobiopsychofamiliosociocultural (with Ethicobiopsychofamiliosocioculturality). Dr Neppe in print has subsquently developed even longer similar systems approach words, but this is the key one being used.  (Note it beats up on Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!)
<br /><br />

Now all of this is in the first play so written  in sciction (sciction, conversagraphs, longest word and  written by Dr Neppe. It's called Quakes.'
