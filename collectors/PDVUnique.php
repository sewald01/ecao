<br /><br />
<b>Pride of place</b> goes to the hard copy bound book of Dr Neppe's original 1983 book, <b>The Psychology of Deja vu: Have I Been Here Before?</b> Published in 1983 by Witwatersrand University Press in Johannesburg, South Africa. We regard this book as so special that it's like the penny black stamp.
This is truly a unique book. It was written by the world authority in the area, was the first modern scientific book on deja vu and the printer messed up by accident! There is nothing on the back cover except the ISBN, and nothing on the spine except the publisher initials. This makes the book very valuable. It's last purchase price was $1, 000 US and it is now available for $1,250. It comes with certification of authenticity (this is included).

<br /><br />
Note that it is likely that the Deja vu  Trilogy may also become valuable. Dr Neppe is still the world authority in this area and the Trilogy of books is also unique.
