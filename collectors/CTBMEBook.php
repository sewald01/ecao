<br /><br />
<h2>Why is  Cry the Beloved Mind; A Voyage of Hope  a potential Collector's item.</h2>
It is unique:

<b>It was the first book written in the defined literary genre of sciction.</b> Also Dr Neppe developed Conversagraphs, and the longest published real word in the English language at that time.  Ethicobiopsychofamiliosociocultural (with Ethicobiopsychofamiliosocioculturality). Dr Neppe in print has subsquently developed even longer similar systems approach words, but this is the key one being used.  (Note it beats up on Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!)
<br /><br />

<h2>Now what is particularly special:</h2>
<b>The electronic book version in PDF is the one that historically is remarkable.</b>  This appears to have been the first electronic book professionally available for download on the Internet through an authorized dealer:
DigitalRiver.com (who may have been the largest download company of software, sold this book in 1989 as electronic download. People did not yet understand the concept, and the electronic version in PDF sold only a small number of copies).
The E-book is still available at $19.99 by downloading at <a href="/shop/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=31">via the Brain Voyage Online Store</a>

<br /><br />

<i>The hard copy bound book comes autographed and can also be valuable.  Generally, this would increase the value three-fold of books on average, but we anticipate this will be far more, particularly if you have a specially inscribed edition.</i>
<br /><br />
<h2>What about bound books personalized by Dr Neppe?</h2>
Personalized hard copy printed versions depend on Dr Neppe's availability because he has to specifically inscribe it to you (or the person you indicate). If he is unavailable or traveling, we will try to let you know by phone or email or both once. You may choose to delay receipt, or choose an autographed or inscribed and customized version that is already available, instead (these usually cost less and your order will be reduced in cost). We retain the right to substitute it with a customized copy (and we will charge you for the customized copy which has a few generic choices (you can choose which one when checking out). Note all books sent out are autographed by Dr Neppe at no extra cost!
<br /><br />
<h2>Is there an advantage to Dr Neppe autographing, customizing or personalizing bound books?</h2>
Almost certainly. The one he most commonly inscribes is Cry the Beloved Mind, but it can be done with any of the books on this site.
Many individuals regard the personal emotional value of their book being inscribed as making their book special. 
We cannot guarantee it, but it is argued that a book autographed by the author increases in value on average three fold. We believe that if a book is customized (e.g. with best wishes), the value increases even more.
At that third level is a personalized book, which shows special intent by the author, and that should increase in value even more. (Personalized hard copy printed versions depend on Dr Neppe's availability. If he is unavailable or traveling, we will let you know: You may choose the delay or choose e.g an autographed or inscribed version that is already available, instead. These usually cost less and your order will be reduced in cost the level of the version you are receiving.) It may be that the Collector's versions that are available will increase in value well beyond that average range.
